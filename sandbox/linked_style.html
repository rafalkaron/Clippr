	“bug” had an amusing origin: It came from the world’s first computer—the Mark 1—a room-size maze of electromechanical circuits built in 1944 in a lab at Harvard University. The computer developed a glitch one day, and no one was able to locate the cause. After hours of searching, a lab assistant finally spotted the problem. It seemed a moth had landed on one of the computer’s circuit boards and shorted it out. From that moment on, computer glitches were referred to as bugs.

It had been wrought, as was easy to perceive, with wonderful skill of needlework; and the stitch (as I am assured by ladies conversant with such mysteries) gives evidence of a now forgotten art, not to be discovered even by the process of picking out the threads.

Your own gift you can present every moment with the cumulative force of a whole life’s cultivation; but of the adopted talent of another, you have only an extemporaneous, half possession. That which each can do best, none but his Maker can teach him. No man yet knows what it is, nor can, till that person has exhibited it. Where is the master who could have taught Shakspeare? Where is the master who could have instructed Franklin, or Washington, or Bacon, or Newton? Every great man is a unique. The Scipionism of Scipio is precisely that part he could not borrow. Shakspeare will never be made by the study of Shakspeare. Do that which is assigned you, and you cannot hope too much or dare too much.

	After all this time and all these adventures, she had still not seen the bottom of him. Not even close. She had seen him laughing and crying, killing and dancing, she’d seen him sleeping and on the squat behind a screen of bushes with his pants down and his ass hung over what he called the Log of Ease. She’d never slept with him as a woman does with a man, but she thought she’d seen him in every other circumstance, and…no. Still no bottom.

	Laughter, Susannah would reflect later, is like a hurricane: once it reaches a certain point, it becomes self-feeding, self-supporting. You laugh not because the jokes are funny but because your own condition is funny. Joe Collins took them to this point with his next sally.

	“Oy?” she said gently. “Will you come with me, honey? It may be we’ll find Jake again. Maybe not quite the same, but still…” Oy, who had been almost completely silent during their trek across the Badlands and the White Lands of Empathica and the open rangelands, now spoke. “Ake?” he said. But he spoke doubtfully, as one who barely remembers, and her heart broke. She had promised herself she wouldn’t cry, and Detta all but guaranteed she wouldn’t cry, but now Detta was gone and the tears were here again.

	“Are you saying you can’t?” Roland asked, injecting (with an effort) a note of disappointed incredulity into his voice. “That you can’t? That Patrick can’t? The Artist can’t?” Patrick’s eyes changed. For a moment Roland saw in them the expression that would be there permanently if he grew to be a man…and the paintings in Sayre’s office said that he would do that, at least on some track of time, in some world.

	You’re the one who never changes, Cort had told him once, and in his voice Roland could have sworn he heard fear…although why Cort should have been afraid of him—a boy—Roland couldn’t tell. It’ll be your damnation, boy. You’ll wear out a hundred pairs of boots on your walk to hell. And Vannay: Those who do not learn from the past are condemned to repeat it. And his mother: Roland, must you always be so serious? Can you never rest? Yet the voice whispered it again (different this time mayhap different)

	Sukienka, którą ma na sobie, to prostokąt z tkaniny w kolorze kawy. Jest ostentacyjnie szeroka w ramionach, a dekolt – zwykły okrągły otwór – sprawia wrażenie aż nazbyt ascetycznego. Odsłaniając na górze tylko szyję – długą, arystokratyczną – sukienka zakrywa ciało na całej swojej długości, lecz nagle, tuż na początku ud, kończy się, zakreślając linię. I za tą linią jest jeszcze cień. Piękno kocha cień, bo w cieniu rodzi się pokusa.
