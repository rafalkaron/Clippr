“bug” had an amusing origin: It came from the world’s first computer—the Mark 1—a room-size maze of electromechanical circuits built in 1944 in a lab at Harvard University. The computer developed a glitch one day, and no one was able to locate the cause. After hours of searching, a lab assistant finally spotted the problem. It seemed a moth had landed on one of the computer’s circuit boards and shorted it out. From that moment on, computer glitches were referred to as bugs.

Boxer could not get beyond the letter D.

On several occasions, indeed, he did learn E, F, G, H, but by the time he knew them, it was always discovered that he had forgotten A, B, C, and D.

But the object that most drew my attention to the mysterious package was a certain affair of fine red cloth, much worn and faded, There were traces about it of gold embroidery, which, however, was greatly frayed and defaced, so that none, or very little, of the glitter was left. It had been wrought, as was easy to perceive, with wonderful skill of needlework; and the stitch (as I am assured by ladies conversant with such mysteries) gives evidence of a now forgotten art, not to be discovered even by the process of picking out the threads. This rag of scarlet cloth—for time, and wear, and a sacrilegious moth had reduced it to little other than a rag—on careful examination, assumed the shape of a letter.

That which each can do best, none but his Maker can teach him. No man yet knows what it is, nor can, till that person has exhibited it. Where is the master who could have taught Shakspeare? Where is the master who could have instructed Franklin, or Washington, or Bacon, or Newton? Every great man is a unique. The Scipionism of Scipio is precisely that part he could not borrow. Shakspeare will never be made by the study of Shakspeare. Do that which is assigned you, and you cannot hope too much or dare too much.

“Not you, Henry,” said Mrs. Fretag. I sat in my chair and Mrs. Fretag stood there looking at me. Then she said, “Henry, were you there?” I sat there trying to think of an answer. I couldn’t. I said, “No, I wasn’t there.” She smiled. “That makes it all the more remarkable.” “Yes, ma’am …” “You can leave, Henry.” I got up and walked out. I began my walk home. So, that’s what they wanted: lies. Beautiful lies. That’s what they needed. People were fools. It was going to be easy for me. I looked around. Juan and his buddy were not following me. Things were looking up.

The parents of rich kids tended to be more patriotic because they had more to lose if the country went under. The poor parents were far less patriotic, and then often professed their patriotism only because it was expected or because it was the way they had been raised. Subconsciously they knew it wouldn’t be any better or worse for <i>them</i> if the Russians or the Germans or the Chinese or the Japanese ran the country, especially if they had dark skin.

That was all a man needed: hope. It was lack of hope that discouraged a man. I remembered my New Orleans days, living on two five-cent candy bars a day for weeks at a time in order to have leisure to write. But starvation, unfortunately, didn't improve art. It only hindered it. A man's soul was rooted in his stomach. A man could write much better after eating a porterhouse steak and drinking a pint of whiskey than he could ever write after eating a nickel candy bar. The myth of the starving artist was a hoax. Once you realized that everything was a hoax you got wise and began to bleed and burn your fellow man. I'd build an empire upon the broken bodies and lives of helpless men, women, and children - I'd shove it to them all the way. I'd show them!

Według zasady „każdemu według jego możliwości" obywatele otrzymują dodatkowo punkty zielone. Tym więcej, im wyższą klasę intelektu reprezentują. Stwarza to bodziec do zwiększenia swych możliwości, do osiągania wyższych klas, a więc do zwiększania swej potencjalnej przydatności społecznej. Liczba zielonych nie zależy od tego, czy się pracuje czy nie. Premiowana jest gotowość i odpowiedni poziom przydatności do pracy. A w końcu ci, którzy pracują, wynagradzani są dodatkowo, wedle zasady: „każdemu według jego pracy", punktami żółtymi. Muszą przecież mieć jakiś bodziec do wydajnego działania. Ot, i masz w skrócie nasz doskonały system społeczno-ekonomiczny.

Stosunek Karla Prona do religii by ł — można by rzec — ostrożny. Należał on do tych, których onże kaznodzieja nazywał „wierzącymi na wszelki wypadek". Oprócz takich jak Karl, duchowny ów wyróżniał jeszcze: szczerze wierzących, niewierzących, czyli ateistów, oraz „antyteistów". Charakterystyczną cechą tych ostatnich było — wedle pastora — to, że uważają za swój ideologiczny obowiązek jadać w każdy piątek wieprzowy kotlet (choćby nawet lekarz zalecał im dietę), by swym postępowaniem sprzeciwiać się Temu, w którego istnienie nie wierzą.

“What he went through in 2008 would have broken anyone else. He didn’t just survive. He kept working and stayed focused.” That ability to stay focused in the midst of a crisis stands as one of Musk’s main advantages over other executives and competitors. “Most people who are under that sort of pressure fray,” Gracias said. “Their decisions go bad. Elon gets hyperrational. He’s still able to make very clear, long-term decisions. The harder it gets, the better he gets. Anyone who saw what he went through firsthand came away with more respect for the guy. I’ve just never seen anything like his ability to take pain.”

<blockquote>
Musk acts differently with his closest friends and family than he does with employees, even those who have worked alongside him for a long time. Among his inner circle, Musk is warm, funny, and deeply emotional.* He might not engage in the standard chitchat, asking a friend how his kids are doing, but he would do everything in his considerable power to help that friend if his child were sick or in trouble. He will protect those close to him at all costs and, when deemed necessary, seek to destroy those who have wronged him or his friends.

<blockquote>
Each facet of Musk’s life might be an attempt to soothe a type of existential depression that seems to gnaw at his every fiber. He sees man as self-limiting and in peril and wants to fix the situation. The people who suggest bad ideas during meetings or make mistakes at work are getting in the way of all of this and slowing Musk down. He does not dislike them as people. It’s more that he feels pained by their mistakes, which have consigned man to peril that much longer. The perceived lack of emotion is a symptom of Musk sometimes feeling like he’s the only one who really grasps the urgency of his mission. He’s less sensitive and less tolerant than other people because the stakes are so high. Employees need to help solve the problems to the absolute best of their ability or they need to get out of the way.

Musk has talked about having more kids, and it’s on this subject that he delivers some controversial philosophizing vis-à-vis the creator of Beavis and Butt-head. “There’s this point that Mike Judge makes in Idiocracy, which is like smart people, you know, should at least sustain their numbers,” Musk said. “Like, if it’s a negative Darwinian vector, then obviously that’s not a good thing. It should be at least neutral. But if each successive generation of smart people has fewer kids, that’s probably bad, too. I mean, Europe, Japan, Russia, China are all headed for demographic implosion. And the fact of the matter is that basically the wealthier—basically wealth, education, and being secular are all indicative of low birth rate. They all correlate with low birth rate. I’m not saying like only smart people should have kids. I’m just saying that smart people should have kids as well. They should at least maintain—at least be a replacement rate. And the fact of the matter is that I notice that a lot of really smart women have zero or one kid. You’re like, ‘Wow, that’s probably not good.’”

Kiedy mówię o kimś, że jest tchórzem, to znaczy, że uważam, iż zachowuje się tchórzliwie - nie znaczy to nic więcej, ponieważ oczywiście nie zajrzę mu w głąb duszy i nie dowiem się, czy jest tchórzem. Tego języka nie mogę jednak użyć do opisu samego siebie: w zakresie mojego doświadczenia pozostaję jedyną osobą, dla której jej słowa, czyny, zaniechania stanowią zaledwie blade i w gruncie rzeczy przypadkowie odbicie tego, co kryje się pod nimi, co stanowi ich przyczynę i źródło. Istnienia owego źródła doświadczam bezpośrednio, podczas gdy części mych zachowań nie jestem w ogóle świadom, a wszystkie odbieram w sposób niepełny, skrzywiony. Sami zawsze ostatni się dowiadujemy, jakiego idjotę zrobiliśmy z siebie w towarzystwie. Lepiej znamy intencje naszych czynów niż owe czyny. Lepiej wiemy, co chcieliśmy powiedzieć, niż co naprawdę powiedzieliśmy. Wiemy, kim chcemy być - nie wiemy, kim jesteśmy.

Nie zna się zasad gry, a jednak się gra. Tak osiągnie się mądrość, której nie osiągnie się w żaden inny sposób. Rodzimy się - nie wiemy po co. Dorastamy - nie wiemy do czego. Żyjemy - nie wiemy dla czego. Umieramy - nie wiemy w co. Szachy mają reguły, zimucha ma reguły, nawet dworskie intrygi rządzą się swoimi zasadami-a jakie są prawidła życia? Kto w nim wygrywa, kto przegrywa, jakie są kryterja zwycięstwa i klęski? Nóż służy do krojenia, zegar do odmierzania czasu, pociąg - do przewożenia towarów i pasażerów; do czego służy człowiek? Nie zna się zasad gry, a jednak się gra. Wszystkie inne gry stanowią wobec niej dziecinne uproszczenia na granicy oszustwa, ogłupiające ćwiczenia w mechanicznej sprawności rozumu. A to jest gra prawdziwa. Jej reguły i cel pozostają nieznane - można o nich wnioskować jedynie z samego gry przebiegu, tylko tak się przejawiają, w naszych własnych posunięciach. Nie ma sędziego. Przegrywasz, wygrywasz - ale dlaczego i skąd ta pewność, nie potrafisz wyrazić w żadnym języku międzyludzkim. Solniczka szachuje musztardę. Nie zna się zasad gry, a jednak się gra.

Czy był pan kiedy zmęczony? Naprawdę zmęczony? Zmęczony ponad wszystko? Bo jak pomierzyć zmęczenie? Tak: rzeczami, które tracą dla ciebie w zmęczeniu znaczenie. Więc na początek nie zależy ci na jedzeniu: tak jesteś zmęczony, że ważne tylko paść w barłóg i zasnąć w cieple. Potem nie zależy ci także na cieple - byle uciec w sen od tej rzeczywistości i swojego w niej ciała, zmęczonego. Ostatni odchodzi cię wstyd: kiedy już żadna rzecz nie obudzi myśli sromotnej, kiedy już wobec nikogo i w żadnej sytuacji nie czujesz się poniżonym i zobojętniałeś na wszelkie upodlenie - znak to wyczerpania ostatecznego. Znałem bowiem ludzi, którzy nie unieśliby ręki, by osłonić się przed ciosem śmiertelnym, lecz dźwigali się w męce, coby nie dać satysfakcji pogardy znienawidzonemu dozorcy.

Panno Jeleno. Nasze kłamstwa więcej o nas zdradzają niż prawda najprawdziwsza. Kiedy mówisz o sobie prawdę - prawda to jest to, co ci się rzeczywiście przydarzyło: twój wycinek historji świata. I przecież nie masz, nie miałaś nad nim żadnej kontroli, nie wybrałaś miejsca swych narodzin, nie wybrałaś sobie rodziców, nie miałaś wpływu na to, jak cię wychowają, nie wybrałaś swojego życia; sytuacje, w jakich cię stawiało, nie były twojej kreacji, ludzie, z którymi musiałaś się zadawać, nie byli tworami twego umysłu i nie dawałaś przyzwolenia na szczęścia i nieszczęścia, jakie stały się twoim udziałem. Większość tego, co nam się przydarza, jest dziełem przypadku. Kłamstwo natomiast w całości pochodzi od ciebie, nad kłamstwem posiadasz kon-:rolę zupełną, zrodziło się z ciebie, tobą się karmi i tylko ciebie opowiada. W czym więc odkrywasz się bardziej: w prawdzie czy w fałszu? Panno Jeleno. Podniosła wzrok.

Czyż w istocie nie na tym zasadza się fenomen Spowiedzi Świętej? Nie liczy się grzech, lecz słowo o grzechu. Nie życie, lecz słowo o życiu. Nie człowiek, lecz o człowieku. Nie prawda, lecz o prawdzie. O tym, co zrobiliśmy. O tym, czego nie zrobiliśmy. O dobru, o złu, o wszystkim, co da się wypowiedzieć. O, o, o.

Jak argumentować wobec kogoś, kto stał się wyrocznią sam dla siebie, to znaczy mierzy wszystko do własnego snu, do przeczucia, wedle jakiegoś wewnętrznego obrazu, który nie jest widocznym dla nikogo innego? A zdarza się często, że właśnie ludzie starzy nabierają podobnego przekonania o własnym autorytecie: sami dla siebie trzymają autorytet patrjarchowie rodu, babki zasuszone, wyrocznice święte. Z takimi ludźmi nie sposób się w ogóle porozumieć. Słuchają cię, jak się słucha szczekania psa albo gaworzenia dziecka. Mówią, ale zawsze tak naprawdę mówią do siebie. Na zewnątrz, do innych wypowiadają tylko rozkazy - rozkazy w formie rozkazów, rozkazy w formie subtelnych manipulacyj, rozkazy w formie kłamstw bezsłownych.

Potem dopiero przychodzą kartografowie Historji i rysują od naszych czynów, słów i podróży mapy owych Dróg. Tajemne sieci pływów Podziemnego Świata nie determinują wyborów człowieka, jednak przyciągają je ku ścieżkom najłatwiejszym, najczęściej przemierzanym. Chodził do szkół, ożenił się, pracował, spłodził dzieci, umarł. Może walczył. Może majątek zgromadził. Może świat zwiedził. Może zbrodnię popełnił. (Już linje pojedyńcze, przerywane).

- Musi się naprawdę co ważnego przydarzyć, żebym potem sen zapamiętał. - A, bo pan śni o przeszłości! Ale - podrapała się trzonkiem pędzla nad brwią - pan przecież nie wierzy w przeszłość. Pan nie wierzy, że sam istnieje, prawda? To jak pan śni? - We śnie, panno Jeleno, we śnie istnieję. - Nie rozumiem. - Czego panna nie rozumie? Śni się, że się istnieje. Inni śnią tak całe życie. - Ha! To o czym śni nieistniejący?

He, he. Oto więc moja dla was mądrość głupia: Idźcie się upić. Idźcie poszaleć z kompanami. Wdrapcie się w góry na szczyt wysoki. Idźcie w tajgę zapolować, stańcie przeciwko zwierzowi dzikiemu. Znajdźcie sobie diewuszkę na sercu i ciele miękką, rozkoszną. Wystąpcie w jakiej politycznej sprawie przeciw wszystkim. Jadajcie do obżarstwa. Darujcie sobie zawsze minutku, żeby spojrzeć w niebo gwiaździste, na śnieg na gałęzi skrzący, żeby psa pogłaskać, dziecko utulić. Wszystko, co zarobicie, wydawajcie na rzeczy materjalne użytku codziennego: ubrania najlepsze, z najprzyjemniejszych w dotyku tkanin, sprzęty najmilsze dla oka, drobiazgi dłoń cieszące. Macie wybrać jedno z dwóch dań - wybierzcie to, którego jeszcze nie próbowaliście. Macie wybrać jedno z dwóch miast - wybierzcie to, w którem jeszcze nie byliście. Macie wybrać życie - wybierzcie to jeszcze nieprzeżyte. - To jest modlitwa na istnienie? To jest modlitwa na ciało! Opadł z sił.

Zapukał młodzian do mędrca - zanucił basem. - Rebe, pyta, dwie diewuszki miłuję, którą mam za żonę wziąć? A która ciebie miłuje, pyta rebe. Ta mówi, że miłuje, i ta mówi, że miłuje, powiada młodzian, ale skąd mnie wiedzieć, czy miłuje naprawdę. A która lepiej kucharzy, pyta rebe. Jedna okropnie, mówi młodzian, i druga paskudnie, ale obie wyuczyć się przysięgają, tylko skąd mnie wiedzieć, czy się wyuczą. A która wierną i posłuszną jest, pyta rebe. Oj, rebe, teraz każda w ogień skoczy i świata poza mną nie widzi, ale za lat dziesięć, dwadzieścia - skąd mnie to wiedzieć! Rebe pokiwał głową i rzekł: Żeń się z brzydszą. Ale dlaczego z brzydszą, dziwi się młodzieniec. Na to objaśnia mędrzec zasadę szczęścia sprawiedliwego: jedną i tak odepchnąć musisz, a ładniejsza łatwo sobie znajdzie męża innego.

Lecz czyż w istocie nie dotyka to niemal wszystkich ludzi? Ponieważ jednak jest nie do wyrażenia w języku drugiego rodzaju - na zawsze pozostaje zamknięte w prywatnej tajemnicy serca. Na zewnątrz natomiast przeciekają cienkie destylaty doznań, krzywe opisy przeczuć, wrażeń niejasnych. Że coś tu się nie zgadza. Że nie do końca jesteśmy tym, kim się pamiętamy. Że żyje w nas ktoś inny, obcy, o obcem doświadczeniu i pamięci. I w tych krótkich chwilach, gdy to on bierze górę i przejmuje władzę nad ciałem, odsłonięta zostaje głębsza prawda. Wiemy, co ujrzymy za następnem wzgórzem, chociaż nigdy nie byliśmy w tym kraju. Po życiu spędzonem za blatem kancelisty, w momencie nagłej przemocy chwytamy za karabin - nigdy nie trzymaliśmy karabinu w ręku - i oddajemy zeń bezbłędny strzał. Sadzają nas w towarzystwie wysokiem, pod manierę cudzoziemską, o której pojęcia nie mamy i mieć nie możemy, a wtem - sztućce w dłoniach, konwersacja nad stołem, słowo i gest i savoir vivre, i okazuje się, że obracamy się w tym bardziej gładko nawet od nich. Uczył nas ktoś? ktoś podpowiedział? znamy to - skąd? Ojcowie dobrotliwi, mężowie potulni - podnosimy wtem pięść na dziecko, na niewiastę w odruchu naturalnym dla zbója zatwardziałego. Tańczymy, chociaż nie umiemy tańczyć.

I teraz doceniło się też całą niezwykłość panny Jeleny. Co zaszło w Ekspresie Transsyberyjskim - co pamiętało się, że tam zaszło - to spięcie charakterów symetrycznych, spotkanie przyjaciela i przyjaciela. Zanim się w ogóle pannę Muklanowiczównę poznało, zanim się pierwszy raz ujrzało ją w wieczornym półnegliżu na korytarzu Luksu, ba, zanim wsiadło się do tego pociągu - już było się przyjaciółmi. Jej potem słowa, co powiedziała i czego nie powiedziała, jej kłamstwa i prawdy, gesty i zaniechania, mimo że przecież jeszcze głęboko w Lecie czynione - nie miały i nie mogły one mieć najmniejszego znaczenia. Zimna Matematyka Charakteru z góry przesądziła o wszystkim. Jelena lepiej sobie z tego zdawała sprawę. Spotkanie człowieka z człowiekiem nigdy nie jest nudne: coś prawdziwego dotyka czegoś prawdziwego.

Przysunąłem lampę jeszcze bliżej. To była panna Jelena, sporządziła swój autoportret z odbicia w wysokiem lustrze owalnem. Czarne włosy luzem na ramiona puszczone, szczupła twarz, oczy chorobliwie duże, niepokojąco wyraźne pod brwiami jak węglem pociągniętemi te brwi zostały pociągnięte węglem. Na szyji miała tę samą aksamitkę z rubinem. Po lewej stronie wisiał kształt nieforemny - fragment czyjejś sylwetki? mebla? cień w lustrze? Jakby ktoś spoglądał Jelenie przez ramię, ktoś drugi, trzeci - Jelena malująca obok Jeleny odbitej w zwierciadle - wszak malarze zazwyczaj nie oddają siebie takimi, jakimi się właśnie widzą, to znaczy malującymi obraz, na którym malują obraz, na którym malują obraz, na którym... Był to zatem autoautoportret; autoportret ze znakiem cudzysłowu; obraz prawdy w wersji Tajtelbaumowej. Panna Muklanowiczówna patrzyła prosto w tremo, prawą rękę wyciągnęła poza kartę w zagadkowym geście - wskazującym? przywołującym? odpychającym? Nawet tam nie spoglądała. Co to miało znaczyć? Obróciłem szkic tak i owak, położyłem na podłodze, popatrzyłem z góry. A jednak umiała rysować! Może za bardzo to ekspresyjne, zbyt szybko i gwałtownie szkicowane - nie wymazywała złych linij, poprawiała je kolejnemi, dziesiątkami, setkami pośpiesznych kresek - ale potrafiła uchwycić obraz i nastrój obrazu. Podrapałem się w oko ślepe. Ta ręka uniesiona w bok, poza wzrok i kadr... Przypomniałem sobie. Zagaś. I ruch ramienia w półmrocznem atdielienju Ekspresu Transsyberyjskiego. Jelena Muklanowiczówna prawdziwsza od Jeleny Muklanowiczówny - to ona.

Ci wszyscy studenci żyjący codzień między książkami, bo między ludźmi żyć nie potrafią, żyjący między słowami, liczbami i idejami, bo między ciałami ciepłemi nie ma dla nich życia, w ciałach ciepłych znajdujący jeno przedmiot obrzydzenia i zezwierzęcenia - w odróżnieniu od idealnego wyobrażenia ciał... Myśliciele, wynalazcy, poszukiwacze Prawdy wszelkich epok, ci wszyscy Nikole Tesle, którzy nigdy się nie ożenili i prędzej dojrzą piękno matematycznie opisywalnej maszyny niż niedojrzałe, niedokończone piękno panny Filipov - wszyscy ci, co swoimi pasjami szczeremi pchają naprzód świat którzy kształtują obraz świata przyszłego... O czym oni śnią, o czym marzą? Czego pragną w kraftwerkach swoich serc nakręcanych? Lodu! Lodu! Świata i człowieka pod Lodem, Historji pod Lodem! Wtedy zaiste będą najpraktyczniejszymi, najbardziej życiowymi z ludzi - gdy mowa pierwszego rodzaju zgodzi się z mową drugiego rodzaju - gdy nie pozostanie już najmniejsza różnica między rzeczywistością idej i rzeczywistością materji.

I disliked weekends. Everybody was out on the streets. Everybody was playing Ping-Pong or mowing their lawn or polishing their car or going to the supermarket or the beach or to the park.

Since I had been born a man, I craved women constantly, the lower the better. And yet women--good women-- frightened me because they eventually wanted your soul, and what was left of mine, I wanted to keep. Basically I craved prostitutes, base women, because they were deadly and hard and made no personal demands. Nothing was lost when they left. Yet at the same time I yearned for a gentle, good woman, despite the overwhelming price. Either way I was lost. A strong man would give up both. I wasn't strong.

I knew she was connecting me with the racetrack people and the boxing crowd, and it was true, I was with them, I was one of them. Katherine knew that there was something about me that was not wholesome in the sense of wholesome is as wholesome does. I was drawn to all the wrong things: I liked to drink, I was lazy, I didn't have a god, politics, ideas, ideals. I was settled into nothingness; a kind of non-being, and I accepted it. It didn't make for an interesting person. I didn't want to be interesting, it was too hard. What I really wanted was only a soft, hazy space to live in, and to be left alone. On the other hand, when I got drunk I screamed, went crazy, got all out of hand. One kind of behavior didn't fit the other. I didn't care.

I was sentimental about many things: a woman's shoes under the bed; one hairpin left behind on the dresser; the way they said, "I'm going to pee . . ."; hair ribbons; walking down the boulevard with them at 1:30 in the afternoon, just two people walking together; the long nights of drinking and smoking, talking; the arguments; thinking of suicide; eating together and feeling good; the jokes, the laughter out of nowhere; feeling miracles in the air; being in a parked car together; comparing past loves at 3 am; being told you snore, hearing her snore; mothers, daughters, sons, cats, dogs; sometimes death and sometimes divorce, but always carrying on, always seeing it through; reading a newspaper alone in a sandwich joint and feeling nausea because she's now married to a dentist with an I.Q. of 95; racetracks, parks, park picnics; even jails; her dull friends, your dull friends; your drinking, her dancing; your flirting, her flirting; her pills, your fucking on the side, and her doing the same; sleeping together. . . .

I walked about feeling worse and worse. Perhaps it was because I had stayed over instead of going home. It was like prolonging the agony. What kind of shit was I? I could certainly play some nasty, unreal games. What was my motive? Was I trying to get even for something? Could I keep on telling myself that it was merely a matter of research, a simple study of the female? I was simply letting things happen without thinking about them. I wasn't considering anything but my own selfish, cheap pleasure. I was like a spoiled high school kid. I was worse than any whore; a whore took your money and nothing more. I tinkered with lives and souls as if they were my playthings. How could I call myself a man? How could I write poems? What did I consist of? I was a bush-league de Sade, without his intellect. A murderer was more straightforward and honest than I was. Or a rapist. I didn't want my soul played with, mocked, pissed on; I knew that much at any rate. I was truly no good. I could feel it as I walked up and down on the rug. No good. The worst part of it was that I passed myself off for exactly what I wasn't--a good man. I was able to enter people's lives because of their trust in me. I was doing my dirty work the easy way. I was writing The Love Tale of the Hyena.

I poured another wine. I couldn't understand what had happened to my life. I had lost my sophistication, I had lost my worldliness, I had lost my hard protective shell. I had lost my sense of humor in the face of other people's problems. I wanted them all back. I wanted things to go easily for me. But somehow I knew they wouldn't come back, at least not right away. I was destined to continue feeling guilty and unprotected.

The time came to put Iris Duarte back on the plane. It was a morning flight which made it difficult. I was used to rising at noon; it was a fine cure for hangovers and would add 5 years to my life. I felt no sadness while driving her to L.A. International. The sex had been fine; there had been laughter. I could hardly remember a more civilized time, neither of us making any demands, yet there had been warmth, it had not been without feeling, dead meat coupled with dead meat. I detested that type of swinging, the Los Angeles, Hollywood, Bel Air, Malibu, Laguna Beach kind of sex. Strangers when you meet, strangers when you part--a gymnasium of bodies namelessly masturbating each other. People with no morals often considered themselves more free, but mostly they lacked the ability to feel or to love. So they became swingers. The dead fucking the dead. There was no gamble or humor in their game--it was corpse fucking corpse. Morals were restrictive, but they were grounded on human experience down through the centuries. Some morals tended to keep people slaves in factories, in churches and true to the State. Other morals simply made good sense. It was like a garden filled with poisoned fruit and good fruit. You had to know which to pick and eat, which to leave alone.

Co takiego oddziela „chcę" od „robię"? Co za dziwny bufor intencji? Nie ciało. Nie niemoc fizyczna. Nie niedowład woli. (Bo CHCĘ!) Dlaczego zatem chcę, a nie wstaję? (Chcę, a nie pracuję.

Czy istnieją ludzie o przyrodzonym im mniejszym i większym współczynniku tarcia nolensowego? I jak go kształtować? Jak zmniejszyć? Chcę wstać. Nie wstaję. Nie wstaję. Nie wstaję. Wstaję. Właśnie TEN moment! TEN interwał! To coś pomiędzy! Miliony ludzi. W domach. Na ulicach. W pracy.W każdej czynności drobnej. Zanim cokolwiek zrobią napięcie, nacisk, parcie.Jak przekłucie przez niewidzialną błonę. Żeby czyn się ziścił. Podniosła się ręka. Z roku na rok trzeba na to więcej i więcej siły woli. Nolensum gęstnieje. Grzęźniemy. Jak w miodzie.W płynnej gumie. Chcemy chcemy chcemy, ale nas nie puszcza. Leżymy, patrząc w sufit. Wola wykrwawia się na podłogę po liniach najmniejszego oporu. Thus came the days of boredom murders.

A mógłbym teraz przepędzać beztroskie dni w rodzinnym majątku w Guberni, polować samotnie w okolicznych lasach, wędrować przez chłodne, cieniste ostępy, otulony zamszową zielenią, zanurzony w zapachu nagrzanej ściółki... Nie,nie mógłbym; nie ja.

Przyjechaliśmy tylko po to, żeby mu dodać otuchy. Ale nie chciał z nami rozmawiać, marnie wyglądał. Mama po niego przyjechała. Przywitał się z nami, powiedział: »dobra, dobra«, i odjechał. To był jedyny człowiek, jakiego znam, który był taki sam i na antenie, i w życiu. Nic nie było podegrane. Jak był wkurwiony, to był wkurwiony, jak załamany albo szczęśliwy, to było czuć.

Większość przyjaźni na tym świecie zawieranych jest właśnie po to, żeby na kimś żerować. A gdy w końcu masz dość i zamykasz kramik, „przyjaciele” przestają cię poznawać na ulicy. Przez wiele lat lubiłem zapraszać znajomych na kolacje do chińskich restauracji. Ostatnio musiałem z tego zrezygnować, gdyż zapożyczyłem się a conto pewnej inwestycji i ledwo wiążę koniec z końcem. Prawie nikt z „dożywianych” przeze mnie ludzi nie wpadł na pomysł, żeby mnie gdzieś zaprosić. Po prostu przestali do mnie dzwonić, bo po co? W dodatku to kosztuje. Jeśli masz coś do zaoferowania, przeróżne hieny tłoczą się ze wszystkich stron. W Sanoku nieustannie przyłazili do mnie kolesie z magnetofonami, żeby „rzucić na taśmę” kilka utworów. Jeden nawet ukradł mi z półki kilka taśm, bo było mu mało. W Warszawie musiałem rozbić na kawałki magnetofon kasetowy, żeby wreszcie dano mi spokój. Odkąd zbieram filmy, muszę je bez przerwy dla kogoś kopiować (I do not mean you, George!). Nie jestem z natury nieużyty i chętnie dzielę się wieloma rzeczami, ale z czasem zauważyłem ze zgrozą, że jest to układ jednostronny: ja daję, a ktoś bierze. Zawsze ktoś coś bierze! Stałem się stacją obsługi. Zrobiłem więc bilans strat i zysków i odkryłem, że wszystko, do czego w życiu doszedłem, zawdzięczam wyłącznie moim rodzicom i sobie, a wszystkie straty zawdzięczam innym.

W artykule zatytułowanym Consequences of Erudite Vernacular Utilized Irrespective of Necessity: Problems with Using Long Words Needlessly [Konsekwencje erudycyjnej szaty stylistycznej aplikowanej w oderwaniu od konieczności: problem nadużywania długich wyrazów] Oppenheimer wykazał, że znajome idee sformułowane pretensjonalnym językiem są odbierane jako oznaka niskiej inteligencji i małej wiarygodności[7].

<blockquote>
Działania z własnej woli odbieramy jako coś zupełnie innego niż fizyczna przyczynowość. Choć to twoja dłoń podnosi solniczkę, nie postrzegasz swojej czynności jako łańcucha fizycznych przyczyn i skutków. Doświadczasz jej jako następstwa decyzji, które podjęła twoja bezcielesna  jaźń, ponieważ chciało ci się dosolić potrawę. Wiele osób uważa za coś naturalnego, że ich dusza jest źródłem i przyczyną ich działań. W 2005 roku psycholog Paul Bloom przedstawił w czasopiśmie „The Atlantic” prowokacyjną tezę, że właśnie nasza wrodzona skłonność do odróżniania przyczynowości fizycznej od intencjonalnej jest przyczyną niemal powszechnego występowania wierzeń religijnych. Bloom zauważa, że „postrzegamy świat przedmiotów jako coś zasadniczo odrębnego od świata umysłów, dzięki czemu potrafimy sobie wyobrazić ciała pozbawione duszy oraz dusze pozbawione ciała”. Wrodzona skłonność do postrzegania dwóch różnych trybów przyczynowości sprawia, że za rzecz naturalną uznajemy dwa centralne wierzenia wielu religii: że ostateczną przyczyną fizycznej rzeczywistości jest niematerialne bóstwo oraz że ciałem kieruje za życia niematerialna dusza, która opuszcza je po śmierci[8]. Zdaniem Blooma nasze dwa sposoby pojmowania przyczynowości ukształtowały się oddzielnie na tle ewolucyjnym, przez co religia została wbudowana w strukturę Systemu 1.

Jeśli odpowiadają ci poglądy polityczne premiera, zapewne podoba ci się też jego głos i wygląd. Skłonność do lubienia (lub nielubienia) wszystkich aspektów danej osoby – łącznie z tymi, których nawet nie zauważamy – nazywamy „efektem halo” (halo effect), czyli efektem poświaty[2]. W psychologii ten termin funkcjonuje od stulecia, jednak w mowie potocznej nie wszedł do powszechnego użytku. To wielka szkoda, bo termin „efekt halo” trafnie nazywa często spotykany błąd poznawczy, który w dużym stopniu wpływa na nasze myślenie o ludziach i sytuacjach. Między innymi ten właśnie efekt sprawia, że System 1 generuje model świata znacznie prostszy i spójniejszy od rzeczywistego.

W ocenach pojedynczych wynik uległ odwróceniu – tu zestaw B został wyceniony znacznie wyżej niż komplet A: odpowiednio na 33 i 23 dolary. Wiemy, dlaczego tak się stało.

Jego obserwacja była trafna: po sytuacji, w której udzielał pochwały, często przychodziło rozczarowanie, a po karze następowała zazwyczaj poprawa. Jednak wniosek, który na tej podstawie wyciągnął na temat skuteczności nagród i kar był całkowicie chybiony. W rzeczywistości zaobserwował zjawisko nazywane „powrotem do średniej”, które w tym wypadku wiązało się z losowymi wahaniami jakości pilotażu. Instruktor oczywiście chwalił szkolonych pilotów tylko za ponadprzeciętną jakość pilotażu. Jednak w takim wypadku pilotowi najprawdopodobniej akurat się poszczęściło, więc następny manewr miał wszelkie szanse być gorszy – czyby go pochwalono, czy nie. Tak samo instruktor wrzeszczał na pilotów do radia tylko wtedy, kiedy ich manewry były wyjątkowo słabe, a tym samym za następnym razem miały wszelkie szanse się poprawić. Instruktor nakładał przyczynowo-skutkową interpretację na nieuniknione fluktuacje losowego procesu.

Nassim Taleb jest w pewnym sensie także psychologiem. W książce The Black Swan wprowadził pojęcie „błędu narracji”[1] (narrative fallacy). Błąd narracji to zjawisko polegające na tym, że nasze poglądy na temat aktualnej rzeczywistości oraz nasze oczekiwania na przyszłość kształtujemy na podstawie nieprawdziwych mentalnych opowieści na temat przeszłości. Błędy narracji są nieuniknione i biorą się stąd, że nieustannie podejmujemy wysiłek zrozumienia rzeczywistości. Te opowieści (wyjaśnienia), które nas przekonują, są raczej proste niż złożone, raczej konkretne niż abstrakcyjne, przypisują większą rolę talentowi, głupocie oraz zamiarom ludzkim niż ślepemu trafowi, a także skupiają się na niewielkiej liczbie istotnych wydarzeń, które miały miejsce, a nie na niezliczonych wydarzeniach, które nie nastąpiły, mimo że mogły. Każde istotne zdarzenie w każdej chwili może się stać ziarnem nowej narracji przyczynowo-skutkowej. Taleb sugeruje, że nieustannie oszukujemy samych siebie, konstruując oparte na wątłych podstawach relacje z przeszłości, które następnie bierzemy za dobrą monetę.

Sedno złudzenia polega na tym, że wydaje nam się, jakobyśmy rozumieli przeszłość, a tym samym, że da się też wiedzieć, jaka będzie przyszłość, jednak w rzeczywistości przeszłość rozumiemy mniej, niż nam się wydaje. Wyraz „wiedzieć” nie jest jedynym, który wywołuje takie złudzenie. Mówiąc o dawnych myślach, które okazały się trafne, potocznie mówimy również, że coś czuliśmy – że coś nas tknęło, że mieliśmy przeczucie albo  podpowiedziała nam intuicja. Zdanie „Od razu czułam, że ich małżeństwo się szybko rozpadnie, ale się myliłam” brzmi dziwnie, podobnie jak każde zdanie o przeczuciu, które okazało się mylne. Żeby móc jasno myśleć o przyszłości, najpierw trzeba oczyścić język, którym mówimy o naszych dawnych przekonaniach.

Efekt halo w połączeniu z błędem skupiania się na skutkach wyjaśniają niezwykłą popularność książek zawierających lekcje płynące z systematycznego badania prosperujących spółek. Jednym z najlepiej znanych przykładów są Wizjonerskie organizacje autorstwa Jima Collinsa i Jerry’ego I. Porrasa[14]. Ich książka zawiera dokładną analizę osiemnastu par konkurujących ze sobą spółek, w których jedna zawsze okazuje się skuteczniejsza od drugiej. Dane służące do porównania to m.in. różne aspekty dotyczące kultury korporacyjnej, strategii lub praktyki zarządzania. „Uważamy, że tę książkę powinien przeczytać każdy dyrektor, kierownik i przedsiębiorca – oznajmiają autorzy. – Ty również możesz zbudować wizjonerską firmę”[15]. Zasadnicze przesłanie Wizjonerskich organizacji i innych podobnych książek mówi, że da się określić najlepsze praktyki zarządzania, a dobre zarządzanie spotka się z nagrodą w postaci dobrych wyników. Obydwa stwierdzenia są przesadzone. Porównywanie spółek lepiej i gorzej sobie radzących to w znacznej mierze porównywanie spółek, którym się bardziej lub mniej poszczęściło. Wiedząc, jak ważną rolę odgrywa tu ślepy traf, musisz się mieć na baczności, słysząc, że z takiego porównania udało się wysnuć wyraźne prawidłowości. Kiedy działa przypadek, prawidłowości mogą być jedynie mirażem.

W jaki sposób informacje wspomagające intuicję są „przechowywane w pamięci”? Niektóre rodzaje intuicji przyswajamy bardzo szybko. Po przodkach odziedziczyliśmy niezmierną łatwość uczenia się, w jakiej sytuacji należy reagować lękiem. Często wystarczy jedno doświadczenie, żeby wzbudzić długotrwałą awersję i lęk. Wielu z nas nosi zakorzenione wspomnienie jakiejś jednej podejrzanej potrawy, które sprawia, że nie za bardzo mamy ochotę wrócić do tamtej restauracji. Każdy człowiek staje się napięty, zbliżając się do miejsca, w którym spotkało go coś nieprzyjemnego, nawet jeśli nie ma powodów sądzić, że przykre zdarzenie mogłoby się powtórzyć. Dla mnie jednym z takich miejsc jest zjazd z autostrady na lotnisko w San Francisco, gdzie wiele lat temu jakiś wściekły kierowca zjechał za mną, opuścił szybę w oknie i obrzucił mnie stekiem bluzgów. Do tej pory nie mam pojęcia, co wzbudziło w nim taką nienawiść, jednak za każdym razem, kiedy dojeżdżam do tego miejsca po drodze na lotnisko, przypomina mi się jego głos. Moje wspomnienie jest całkowicie świadome i w pełni wyjaśnia towarzyszące mu emocje. Jednak często jest tak, że czujesz się nieswojo, widząc jakieś miejsce albo słysząc określony zwrot, choć nie jesteś w stanie sobie przypomnieć, jakie zdarzenie wywołało taką reakcję. Jeśli poczujesz niepokój, a następnie spotka cię przykre doświadczenie, z perspektywy czasu nazwiesz swój niepokój „intuicją”. Taki tryb uczenia się emocjonalnego jest ściśle związany z mechanizmem funkcjonującym w słynnych eksperymentach Pawłowa nad odruchami warunkowymi, w których psy nauczyły się rozpoznawać dźwięk dzwonka jako sygnał zbliżającego się posiłku. Można powiedzieć, że psy Pawłowa nabierały wyuczonej nadziei. Wyuczone lęki przychodzą nam jeszcze łatwiej.

Niedawne badania z dziedziny psychologii „wyborów dokonywanych w warunkach niedostatku” sugerują, że efekt posiadania nie pojawia się także wśród osób biednych. Z punktu widzenia teorii perspektywy bycie biednym oznacza życie poniżej własnego punktu odniesienia. Pewne dobra są biednym potrzebne, ale niedostępne, dlatego biedni są zawsze „stratni”. Kiedy więc otrzymują niewielką kwotę, traktują ją jako zmniejszenie straty, a nie zysk. Pieniądze pomagają wspiąć się nieco w kierunku punktu odniesienia, jednak biedni zawsze poruszają się po stromym wycinku funkcji wartości. Ludzie biedni myślą jak traderzy[16], jednak dynamika jest tu całkiem inna. O ile trader nauczył się traktować obojętnie różnicę między zyskaniem dobra a rezygnacją z niego, o tyle problemem człowieka biednego jest to, że musi wybierać wyłącznie między stratami. Pieniądze wydane na jedno dobro oznaczają utratę innego dobra, które można było uzyskać zamiast tego. Dla biednych koszt równa się utracie.

A więc dlaczego modlisz się ze mną? – Moja mama mówiła, że należy postępować tak, żeby nie urazić niczyich zwyczajów – odparł Par’chin. – Pewien mądry starzec powiedział mi raz, że nasze kultury są obrazą same dla siebie. Że należy zdobyć się na wysiłek i powstrzymać chęć, żeby się nawzajem obrażać. A poza tym... – Potrząsnął głową. – Poza tym to, czy Everam mieszka w Niebie, czy też w twojej wyobraźni, chyba przestaje mieć dla mnie znaczenie. Wystarczy mi, że to głos, który ci mówi, że masz postępować właściwie, a to już dużo. Wielu ludzi nie ma nawet tego.

Niechęć do ponoszenia strat bierze się ze stosunku sił dwóch motywów: silniej popycha nas pragnienie uniknięcia straty niż pragnienie zdobycia zysków. Czasami punktem odniesienia jest status quo, ale może nim być także cel, który sobie stawiamy w przyszłości: niezrealizowanie celu jest utratą, a przekroczenie go zyskiem. Jak możemy się domyślać, w sytuacji, gdy dominuje negatywność, te dwa motywy nie będą równie silne[9]. Niechęć do porażki, jaką jest niezrealizowanie celu, będzie znacznie silniejsza od pragnienia przekroczenia celu.

Strategia, która pozwala patrzeć na decyzje jako na część większej całości, jest analogiczna do spojrzenia z zewnątrz w procesie planowania, o którym pisałem wcześniej. Kiedy patrzymy na plany z zewnątrz, kierujemy uwagę nie na konkretną sytuację, lecz na statystyki dotyczące rezultatów w podobnych sytuacjach. Spojrzenie z zewnątrz to nic innego jak szerokie kadrowanie zastosowane w kontekście planowania. Strategia reagowania na ryzyko to użycie szerokiego kadru, dzięki czemu konkretna ryzykowna decyzja zostaje osadzona w zbiorze podobnych wyborów.

Spojrzenie z zewnątrz i strategia reagowania na ryzyko są lekiem na dwa różne błędy poznawcze, które wywierają wpływ na wiele decyzji: przesadny optymizm (charakterystyczny dla złudzenia planowania) i przesadną ostrożność (wywołaną niechęcią do ponoszenia strat). Te dwa błędy mają przeciwstawne działanie. Przesadny optymizm chroni osoby i organizacje przed paraliżem decyzyjnym powodowanym przez niechęć do ponoszenia strat; niechęć do strat chroni przed głupstwami popełnianymi pod wpływem nadmiaru optymizmu. Decydentom zapewnia to komfort psychiczny: optymiści wierzą, że ich decyzje są roztropniejsze, niż to jest naprawdę, a decydenci reagujący awersją

And when the farmer has got his house, he may not be the richer but the poorer for it, and it be the house that has got him. As I understand it, that was a valid objection urged by Momus against the house which Minerva made, that she "had not made it movable, by which means a bad neighborhood might be avoided"; and it may still be urged, for our houses are such unwieldy property that we are often imprisoned rather than housed in them; and the bad neighborhood to be avoided is our own scurvy selves. I know one or two families, at least, in this town, who, for nearly a generation, have been wishing to sell their houses in the outskirts and move into the village, but have not been able to accomplish it, and only death will set them free.

"But," says one, "you do not mean that the students should go to work with their hands instead of their heads?" I do not mean that exactly, but I mean something which he might think a good deal like that; I mean that they should not play life, or study it merely, while the community supports them at this expensive game, but earnestly live it from beginning to end. How could youths better learn to live than by at once trying the experiment of living? Methinks this would exercise their minds as much as mathematics. If I wished a boy to know something about the arts and sciences, for instance, I would not pursue the common course, which is merely to send him into the neighborhood of some professor, where anything is professed and practised but the art of life;—to survey the world through a telescope or a microscope, and never with his natural eye; to study chemistry, and not learn how his bread is made, or mechanics, and not learn how it is earned; to discover new satellites to Neptune, and not detect the motes in his eyes, or to what vagabond he is a satellite himself; or to be devoured by the monsters that swarm all around him, while contemplating the monsters in a drop of vinegar. Which would have advanced the most at the end of a month—the boy who had made his own jackknife from the ore which he had dug and smelted, reading as much as would be necessary for this—or the boy who had attended the lectures on metallurgy at the Institute in the meanwhile, and had received a Rodgers' penknife from his father? Which would be most likely to cut his fingers?... To my astonishment I was informed on leaving college that I had studied navigation!—why, if I had taken one turn down the harbor I should have known more about it. Even the poor student studies and is taught only political economy, while that economy of living which is synonymous with philosophy is not even sincerely professed in our colleges. The consequence is, that while he is reading Adam Smith, Ricardo, and Say, he runs his father in debt irretrievably.

There is a certain class of unbelievers who sometimes ask me such questions as, if I think that I can live on vegetable food alone; and to strike at the root of the matter at once—for the root is faith—I am accustomed to answer such, that I can live on board nails. If they cannot understand that, they cannot understand much that I have to say. For my part, I am glad to hear of experiments of this kind being tried; as that a young man tried for a fortnight to live on hard, raw corn on the ear, using his teeth for all mortar. The squirrel tribe tried the same and succeeded. The human race is interested in these experiments, though a few old women who are incapacitated for them, or who own their thirds in mills, may be alarmed.

My furniture, part of which I made myself—and the rest cost me nothing of which I have not rendered an account—consisted of a bed, a table, a desk, three chairs, a looking-glass three inches in diameter, a pair of tongs and andirons, a kettle, a skillet, and a frying-pan, a dipper, a wash-bowl, two knives and forks, three plates, one cup, one spoon, a jug for oil, a jug for molasses, and a japanned lamp. None is so poor that he need sit on a pumpkin. That is shiftlessness. There is a plenty of such chairs as I like best in the village garrets to be had for taking them away. Furniture! Thank God, I can sit and I can stand without the aid of a furniture warehouse. What man but a philosopher would not be ashamed to see his furniture packed in a cart and going up country exposed to the light of heaven and the eyes of men, a beggarly account of empty boxes? That is Spaulding's furniture. I could never tell from inspecting such a load whether it belonged to a so-called rich man or a poor one; the owner always seemed poverty-stricken. Indeed, the more you have of such things the poorer you are. Each load looks as if it contained the contents of a dozen shanties; and if one shanty is poor, this is a dozen times as poor. Pray, for what do we move ever but to get rid of our furniture, our exuviœ: at last to go from this world to another newly furnished, and leave this to be burned? It is the same as if all these traps were buckled to a man's belt, and he could not move over the rough country where our lines are cast without dragging them—dragging his trap. He was a lucky fox that left his tail in the trap. The muskrat will gnaw his third leg off to be free. No wonder man has lost his elasticity. How often he is at a dead set! "Sir, if I may be so bold, what do you mean by a dead set?" If you are a seer, whenever you meet a man you will see all that he owns, ay, and much that he pretends to disown, behind him, even to his kitchen furniture and all the trumpery which he saves and will not burn, and he will appear to be harnessed to it and making what headway he can. I think that the man is at a dead set who has got through a knot-hole or gateway where his sledge load of furniture cannot follow him. I cannot but feel compassion when I hear some trig, compact-looking man, seemingly free, all girded and ready, speak of his "furniture," as whether it is insured or not. "But what shall I do with my furniture?"—My gay butterfly is entangled in a spider's web then. Even those who seem for a long while not to have any, if you inquire more narrowly you will find have some stored in somebody's barn. I look upon England today as an old gentleman who is travelling with a great deal of baggage, trumpery which has accumulated from long housekeeping, which he has not the courage to burn; great trunk, little trunk, bandbox, and bundle. Throw away the first three at least. It would surpass the powers of a well man nowadays to take up his bed and walk, and I should certainly advise a sick one to lay down his bed and run. When I have met an immigrant tottering under a bundle which contained his all—looking like an enormous wen which had grown out of the nape of his neck—I have pitied him, not because that was his all, but because he had all that to carry. If I have got to drag my trap, I will take care that it be a light one and do not nip me in a vital part. But perchance it would be wisest never to put one's paw into it.

Some are "industrious," and appear to love labor for its own sake, or perhaps because it keeps them out of worse mischief; to such I have at present nothing to say. Those who would not know what to do with more leisure than they now enjoy, I might advise to work twice as hard as they do—work till they pay for themselves, and get their free papers. For myself I found that the occupation of a day-laborer was the most independent of any, especially as it required only thirty or forty days in a year to support one. The laborer's day ends with the going down of the sun, and he is then free to devote himself to his chosen pursuit, independent of his labor; but his employer, who speculates from month to month, has no respite from one end of the year to the other.

I have never felt lonesome, or in the least oppressed by a sense of solitude, but once, and that was a few weeks after I came to the woods, when, for an hour, I doubted if the near neighborhood of man was not essential to a serene and healthy life. To be alone was something unpleasant. But I was at the same time conscious of a slight insanity in my mood, and seemed to foresee my recovery. In the midst of a gentle rain while these thoughts prevailed, I was suddenly sensible of such sweet and beneficent society in Nature, in the very pattering of the drops, and in every sound and sight around my house, an infinite and unaccountable friendliness all at once like an atmosphere sustaining me, as made the fancied advantages of human neighborhood insignificant, and I have never thought of them since.

Individuals, like nations, must have suitable broad and natural boundaries, even a considerable neutral ground, between them. I have found it a singular luxury to talk across the pond to a companion on the opposite side. In my house we were so near that we could not begin to hear—we could not speak low enough to be heard; as when you throw two stones into calm water so near that they break each other's undulations. If we are merely loquacious and loud talkers, then we can afford to stand very near together, cheek by jowl, and feel each other's breath; but if we speak reservedly and thoughtfully, we want to be farther apart, that all animal heat and moisture may have a chance to evaporate. If we would enjoy the most intimate society with that in each of us which is without, or above, being spoken to, we must not only be silent, but commonly so far apart bodily that we cannot possibly hear each other's voice in any case.

In every aspect of life, we’re told, there is a HubSpotty way of doing things. Nobody can really explain what HubSpotty means, but it is a real word that people use, all the time. Some people are more HubSpotty than others. Some are 100 percent HubSpotty, possessed of a HubSpottiness that is so complete as to be beyond reproach. Those people “bleed orange.” Their ideas cannot be questioned. They can do pretty much anything they want. They are the HubSpot equivalent of a Level 8 Operating Thetan in Scientology. Newcomers are by definition not HubSpotty yet. We have to earn that designation, and it takes time. Nobody just comes in and gets accepted. A big part of establishing your HubSpottiness involves being relentlessly upbeat and positive. HubSpot is like a corporate version of Up with People, the inspirational singing group from the 1970s, but with a touch of Scientology. It’s a cult based around marketing. The Happy!! Awesome!! Start-up Cult, I began to call it. Instead of ID badges, the company gives out rubber ID bracelets with the HubSpot logo on them. The bracelets contain a transponder that unlocks doors into different parts of the office. It feels ridiculous and cultish to wear a special bracelet, but you can’t get anywhere without one.

The Netscape IPO set off the dotcom frenzy. In Silicon Valley it was as if someone had flipped a switch. Suddenly there was a new business model: Grow fast, lose money, go public. That model persists today. It’s a simple racket. Venture capitalists pump millions of dollars into a company. The company spends some of that money coding up a “minimum viable product,” or MVP, a term coined by Eric Ries, author of The Lean Startup, which has become a bible for new tech companies, and then pumps enormous sums into acquiring customers —by hiring sales reps, marketers, and public relations people who can get publicity, put on flashy conferences, and generate hype—brand and buzz, as HubSpot calls it. The losses pile up, but the revenue number rises. Basically the company is buying one-dollar bills and selling them for seventy-five cents, but it doesn’t matter, because mom-and-pop investors are only looking at the revenue growth rate. They have been told that if a company can just grow big enough, fast enough, eventually profits will arrive. Only sometimes they don’t. Zynga, Groupon, and Twitter are a few big examples. In the past five years, from 2010 through 2014, Zynga racked up annual losses totaling more than $800 million; Groupon lost nearly $1 billion; and Twitter reported annual net losses that added up to more than $1.5 billion, according to the 10-K forms they filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

There’s also a sense among start-ups that it’s okay for them to break the rules because they’re underdogs competing against huge opponents; they’re David, firing his slingshot at Goliath. Another argument is that the big guys break just as many rules as the little guys. Everybody cheats, and only suckers drive inside the lines.

4chan began with users sharing Japanese anime, created by a teenage Chris Poole (aka moot) and based on the anime-sharing site 2chan. Poole’s main influence for the style of the site was inspired by a Something Awful subforum known as the Anime Death Tentacle Rape Whorehouse. It was set up in October 2003 and by 2011, it grew to around 750 million page views a month. New users were called newfags and older users oldfags. It became a massively influential and creative forum known for pranks, memes and images that ‘cannot be unseen’. The culture of the site was not only deeply and shockingly misogynist, but also self-deprecating in its own self-mockery of nerdish ‘beta’ male identity. Cultural touchstones included war-based video games and films like Fight Club and The Matrix. There was no registration or login required, so posts were typically all under the username ‘Anonymous’.

This culture of anonymity fostered an environment where the users went to air their darkest thoughts. Weird pornography, injokes, nerdish argot, gory images, suicidal, murderous and incestuous thoughts, racism and misogyny were characteristic of the environment created by this strange virtual experiment, but it was mostly funny memes. Poole has called 4chan a ‘meme factory’ and it undoubtedly created countless memes that made their way into mainstream Internet-culture. The most famous early examples of these were probably LOLcats, a cat-picture based style of image macro, and rickrolling, the use of a link to seemingly serious content that sends its user to a video of Rick Astley singing Never Gonna Give You Up.

Transgression has been embraced as a virtue within Western social liberalism ever since the 60s, typically applied today as it is in bell hooks’ Teaching to Transgress. So elevated has the virtue of transgression become in the criticism of art, argued Kieran Cashell, that contemporary art critics have been faced with a challenge: ‘either support transgression unconditionally or condemn the tendency and risk obsolescence amid suspicions of critical conservatism’ as the great art critic Robert Hughes often was. But, Cashell wrote, on the value placed upon transgression in contemporary art: ‘In the pursuit of the irrational, art has become negative, nasty and nihilistic.’ Literary critic Anthony Julius has also noted the resulting ‘unreflective contemporary endorsement of the transgressive’.

The cult of the moral transgressor as a heroic individual is rooted in Romanticism. But, as Simon Reynolds and Joy Press explore in their study of post-war rebel masculinity Sex Revolts, it was revived in twentiethcentury countercultures. Norman Mailer posited the psychopath as a noble and transgressive figure in fiction. He saw the hipster (which had somewhat different connotations at the time to the beard oil-applying variety of today) as borrowing from the tradition of the noble psychopath of fiction in his disregard for social conventions and the mainstream, and perceived the fictional psychopath as a symbol of being freed from sexual, social and moral inhibitions. The psychopath, like the artist, privileges id over superego and desire over moral constraints. Dostoyevsky’s antihero in Crime and Punishment, Raskolnikov, asserted his own right to transcend the morality of the lesser masses when he killed a ‘worthless’ old woman.

While the roots of this whole political sensibility may be found in academia and activist culture, its emergence into the mainstream that led to Hillary using terms like ‘check your privilege’ and ‘intersectionality’ was the culmination of years of online development on Tumblr, in fan cultures, on previous platforms like LiveJournal and on a mixture of social media.

Simultaneously, we are witnessing the erosion of the influence of brand names. Not that brands don't have value, but that value is not the blind force it used to be. A generation or two ago, you chose your brands early in life and stuck by them loyally until your last shopping trip. If you were a Buick man, you bought Buicks. If you were a Marlboro woman, you smoked Marlboros. You chose your team—Coke or Pepsi, Maytag or Speed Queen, Camay or Ivory—and stayed with it. Today, in some ways, every decision is a new one, and nothing can be taken for granted. That means that while branding and traditional advertising build brand awareness and purchase predisposition, those factors do not always translate into sales. The standard tools of marketing work, they just don't work anywhere near as well as they used to. Many purchasing decision are made, or can be heavily influenced, on the floor of the store itself. Shoppers are susceptible to impressions and information they acquire in stores, rather than just relying on brand-name loyalty or advertising to tell them what to buy.

That's what really taught me the similarity between people walking and drivers driving—the best sign in either case is one you can read fast, and positioned so you can read it while moving. And the only way to achieve that, in most instances, is to break the information down into pieces and lay them out one at a time, in a logical, orderly sequence.

We did a study for Thomasville, the furniture maker, and thought that there, too, getting the man more involved would make it easier to sell such big-ticket items. The solution was simple: Create graphic devices, like displays and posters, showing the steps that go into making the furniture, and use visuals, like cross sections and exploded views, to prove that in addition to looking good, the pieces were well made. Emphasizing construction would do a lot toward overcoming male resistance to the cost of new furniture, but the graphics would also give men something to study while their wives examined upholstery and styling.

How did we not notice? Because men and women use technology in very different ways. Men are in love with the technology itself, with the gee-whiz factor, with the horsepower and the bang for the buck. Back before cars had computerized innards, the commonest sight in America was three or four guys assembled around the raised hood of a car, watching its owner adjust a carburetor or install a generator, and offering copious advice on how it could be done better. Today those men are gathered around the barbecue comparing the size of their hard drives and the speed of their modems. As they say, it s a dude thing. Women generally take a completely different approach to the world of high tech. They take technologies and turn them into appliances. They strip even the fanciest gizmo of all that is mysterious and jargony in order to determine its usefulness. Women look at technology and see its purpose, its reason—what it can do. The promise of technology is always that it will make our lives easier and more efficient. Women are the ones who demand that it fulfill its promise.

That's a wise approach, for it acknowledges the fact that a product or service meant for youthful shoppers thereby declares itself off-limits to the rest of us. Clarion no longer exists, but it was for a while a heavily promoted cosmetics brand. It was an early user of interactive computer fixtures—women would type in some information about their coloring and skin type, and the computer would tell them which Clarion products to buy. For some reason, though, the fixtures gradually migrated downward to low shelves, positioned perfectly for adolescent girls. They returned the favor by making use of the computers. Once adult women saw this, naturally, they assumed that Clarion was meant for be-ginners, and steered clear. Thus was Clarion s reputation sealed, and before long it was withdrawn from the market.

First, a word about the whole issue of time and perception. There's the watch on your wrist, which is probably a highly accurate instrument, but there's an even more important clock inside your head. That mental timepiece is highly susceptible to outside influences, yet it counts more than any Rolex. We've interviewed lots of shoppers on the subject and have found this interesting result: When people wait up to about a minute and a half, their sense of how much time has elapsed is fairly accurate. Anything over ninety or so seconds, however, and their sense of time distorts—if you ask how long they've been waiting, their honest answer can often be a very exaggerated one. If they've waited two minutes, they'll say it's been three or four. In the shopper's mind, the waiting period goes from being a transitional pause in a larger enterprise (purchasing goods) to being a full-fledged activity of its own.

The organization of cashier lines is still one of the great ongoing quandaries in the world of shopping. Without question, the fastest, fairest system places customers in a single checkout line. This way guarantees that shoppers are taken in the order they arrive, and there's no angst about whether they've chosen the swiftest line. There's just one problem: You will sometimes have one very long line—a worrisome sight for a shopper in a hurry. Somehow, three lines of five customers each promise less of an ordeal than a single line of fifteen people. It's irrational but true, and such is the difference between perception and reality.

In Part 2 of this book I explore four tech-related tendencies—what I call “The Four Factors”—that contribute to worker unhappiness. They are: • MONEY: We make a lot less today than we did a generation ago. The scale and scope of the robbery that has been carried out on workers in the West amount to trillions of dollars per year— and the heist has been helped along by technology. You’ll find the numbers in Chapter 6. • INSECURITY: We live in constant fear of losing our jobs. That’s because employers, especially in Silicon Valley, are adopting a “new compact” with workers. As I explain in Chapter 7, your job is no longer the start of a career, but just a short-term “tour of duty.” • CHANGE: New technologies, new methodologies, kooky new arrangements for where we work and how we work—we are overwhelmed by a workplace that never stays the same for very long. In Chapter 8, you’ll find research that shows that being exposed to persistent, low-grade change leads to depression and anxiety. The suffering is akin to what we experience after the death of a loved one or spending time in combat. • DEHUMANIZATION: Once upon a time we used technology, but today technology uses us. We’re hired by machines, managed by them, even fired by them. We’re monitored and measured, constantly surveilled. As I explain in Chapter 9, we are expected to become more like machines ourselves.

The new compact says, essentially, that corporations owe no loyalty to workers, and that workers should not expect any kind of job security. This compact encourages workers to view themselves as independent agents, competing against one another for work. Each individual is a start-up—“the startup of you,” as Hoffman once put it in a book by that title. Hoffman describes the new compact in his second book, The Alliance: Managing Talent in a Networked Age. The gist is that a job is just a transaction; you’ll work here for a year or two, then go on to the next thing.

When your training is complete, you’ll start each day with a “stand-up meeting” and work in a “scrum” with a “Scrum Master,” and you’ll pick tasks from a “backlog” of “story points.” You’ll work in “sprints,” and at the end of each sprint you’ll do a “demo,” and a “retrospective,” and then you’ll start a fresh sprint. Instead of a scrum, you might have a “kanban,” which is more or less the same thing, or you might have a “scrumban,” which combines the two—and I am not just making that up. The groups must coordinate with each other, so in each morning meeting the team will nominate an “ambassador,” and that poor bastard will have to attend a second meeting, called a “Scrum of Scrums,” which keeps the scrums humming. Similarly, the Scrum Masters need to meet with other Scrum Masters, and they all report up to an Agile Coach, but each coach can only manage a few Scrum Masters, so you may need a bunch of coaches, and they will need their own dedicated Agile Practice department. So-called Agilists now have their own career path, climbing the ladder from Agile Coach to Agile Evangelist to Enterprise Agility Coach and finally to the top of the mountain: Agile Practice Leader. At some point you will likely become aware that a methodology that purported to make your organization more agile and nimble has instead added an extra layer of management to your company—it’s like trying to make your car go faster by hooking it up to a second car filled with a team of car-speeder-uppers.

Berns added a twist by giving subjects a choice. They could get a big shock right away—meaning they could control the timing. Or they could wait and not know when the shock would come, but get a milder shock. Most chose to get the big shock right away. That was obviously a bad decision. More pain is worse than less pain. Berns concluded that people who are scared basically can’t think straight. “Fear—whether of pain or losing a job—does strange things to decision-making. Fear overtakes our brains and makes it impossible to concentrate on anything but saving our skin. When the fear system of the brain is active, exploratory activity and risk-taking are turned off,” he wrote.

In his famous essay in the New York Times magazine, Friedman argued that people who manage companies should have only one goal, which is to make as much money as possible for their investors. CEOs should not worry about “providing employment, eliminating discrimination, [or] avoiding pollution,” Friedman wrote. The top executives of a corporation were not free to do whatever they wanted. Those executives were employees of the shareholders. If they wanted to do charity work in their spare time, with their own money, that was fine. But at work they were dutybound to do nothing but generate the biggest possible return for investors.

Then came the Internet, and everything sped up. It was like those scenes in Star Wars when the spaceship makes the jump to light speed. Companies that were already sold on the Friedman doctrine and committed to exploiting labor and pushing down wages now found themselves armed with an incredibly powerful new weapon: outsourcing. By the year 2000, we had speedy global connections, software that enabled free communication, and computers whose power was doubling every eighteen months. Information technology and back-office work shifted to India. Manufacturing moved to China. From 2000 to 2016, India’s GDP quintupled. China’s GDP grew from $1 trillion to $11 trillion. In the United States, over the same sixteen years, GDP grew 33 percent.

Where are those millions of laid-off retail workers going to go? People in Silicon Valley like to talk about “creative destruction,” a term popularized by economist Joseph Schumpeter. In the happyface version of how this works, technology kills old jobs, but it also creates new and better ones. Factory workers lose their jobs to robots, but then go to work at the company that makes the robots.

Most tech companies grant workers options (or, if the company is already public, restricted stock units) and dole them out over a fouryear period, so workers get 25 percent each year. But as journalist Brad Stone reports in his book The Everything Store, Amazon back-loads the grant so that workers get 5 percent after year 1, 15 percent at the end of year 2, and then 20 percent every six months for the next two years. You might say Amazon back-loads the stock grants to create an incentive for employees to stay at the company. The other explanation is that Amazon knows most people can’t survive for long in its brutal culture, and back-loading means the company will pay out less.

You can peruse dozens of corporate culture decks online. If you are going to read through them, you should consider putting on a raincoat and a face shield because you’re about to get splattered with buckets of sanctimonious new-economy corporate goo. They all say a lot of the same things. They’re a team, and managers are coaches. They like ethics, honesty, empathy, transparency. They are remarkable, adaptable, passionate, curious, and fearless. They are the best of the best, yet they are “ego-less” and humble. They celebrate success and learn from failure. They like freedom and hate rules. Oh, and finally: they’re all unique. Every one of them. There’s a name for this kind of earnest but mindless marketing guff: I call it meaningfullessness. The people who write culture codes have mastered it.

No one, not a single person, felt sanguine about getting fired. They were hurt. They were bitter. They took it personally. Steve Jobs once said in a commencement speech that no one wants to die, and that “Even people who want to go to heaven don’t want to die to get there.” Similarly, even people who had been miserable in their jobs and wanted to find better work still felt angry and hurt about being fired. The termination might have come as a relief, but it also felt like a final insult.

For one thing, a lot of the change is pointless. A survey of 1,500 executives found that only 30 percent of “change initiatives” produce any lasting improvement, Rumbles said. “It’s just change for the sake of change,” she said. Companies would be better off if they changed less frequently, and at a more measured rate, and put more thought into it. They should also put rest periods between each change. A corporate change is “almost like a bereavement,” Rumbles said. New ideas are more likely to take hold if a period of change is followed by a period of stability.

Even the most basic thing we do—talking to each other—increasingly has become mediated by technology, thanks not only to email and text messaging, but to newer platforms like Slack and HipChat. Have you ever seen two people at work sitting side by side, or facing one another, communicating via text messages rather than actually talking to one another? Apparently, a lot of us now prefer this. The problem is that the electronic tools that purport to connect us can also have the effect of making us feel isolated and disconnected from one another—“alone together,” as MIT sociologist Sherry Turkle puts it.

The one thing that seems to mean even more to Erickson than the promotions is that when he runs into Teran at the office, the boss takes a minute to chat with him. Teran asks about Erickson’s son and even remembers the kid’s nickname. “I damn near cried the first time he asked me that,” Erickson says. “His plate is full, he’s doing so much, but he’s taking time to ask me how I’m doing, how my son is doing, to call my son by his nickname.” How can such a small gesture mean so much? Remembering the name of someone’s kid, or sending someone flowers when they have a baby—these are common courtesies, and they take little effort or expense. Yet people are moved by these gestures, and I suspect it’s because a lot of workers, especially the lower-income workers who toil in the front lines of many organizations, go through most of their work life feeling invisible. When a boss takes the time to actually see them, it blows them away. In terms of bang for the buck, these small gestures might represent one of the most powerful management techniques in the world.

There’s something about outward appearances that has always been important to me. I always thought I was so ugly. I mean, I really did. I remember being in L.A. at my mom’s house as a little kid and just staring into the mirror for hours. It was like, if I looked long enough, maybe I’d finally be handsome. It never worked. I just got uglier and uglier. Nothing about me ever seemed good enough. And there was this sadness inside me—this hopelessness. Focusing on my physical appearance was at least easier than trying to address the internal shit. I could control the external—at least, to a point. I could buy different clothes, or cut my hair, or whatever. The pit opening up inside me was too frightening to even look at. But I could get a new pair of shoes and, here, I can make sure I’m clean shaven and have good skin. It’s so shallow and ridiculous and I see it, I do, but I’m powerless to change. I mean, I don’t know how to change. All I can do is just shoot more goddamn drugs.

I smoke cigarettes and wait and scribble in my notebook. I try to write out a resumé so I can type it up once it’s my turn. Problem is, I can’t really leave any references. My work history is solid and my jobs always start off great, but soon degenerate and end badly. Usually I just stop showing up for work one day. That’s what happened at that rehab in Malibu. That’s what happened with the six jobs before that. Actually, I’ve never seen a job all the way through to the end—not even in sobriety. I always get so overwhelmed trying to do everything perfectly. I can’t do a job and not put everything I have into it. I need to be the best employee, the best coworker, the best whatever. I need everyone to like me and I just burn out bending over backward to make that happen. Having people be mad at me is my worst fear. I can’t stand it. There is this crazy fear I have of being rejected by anyone—even people I don’t really care about. It’s always better to leave them first, cut all ties, and disappear. They can’t hurt me that way—no one can. That’s why I have no references. But, of course, there’s always the hope that my new employer won’t check them out.

Those nights I’d slept in my car outside the Presidio, I’d watched the groups of cyclists climbing up the forest road. It was hard to believe that I had once been like that, pulling away on a sprint, spending five or six hours at a time on the bike. I looked at those riders and I told myself that I was better off sitting in the car, loaded outta my mind. But the thing was I had experienced some of the good life that the twelve steps had to offer. I remembered riding my bike with Spencer through the Marina as the sun rose over the Hollywood hills. I remembered him telling me how much he loved his life, and in those moments, I felt the same way. I just hadn’t been willing to fight through the difficult moments with the faith that it would get better—that maybe, one day, I could have what Spencer had—a beautiful life.

And so when I write, that’s like my answer back—to all the art that has meant something to me in my life. It’s a cool idea and I believe in it.

Otóż, według mnie, nie tylko muzyką, także życiem rządzi rytm. Gdy człowiek traci w sobie rytm, traci i nadzieję. Cóż jest płacz, cóż rozpacz, jeśli nie bra​kiem rytmu. Cóż pamięć, jeśli nie rytmem.

Źle mnie pan zrozumiał. Nie chodziło mi o to, żeby było nam widniej. Nieraz nie chce mi się czytać, nie chce mi się słuchać muzyki. Jeszcze tak jak teraz, jesienią czy zimą, wieczory długie, a ja z tymi psami, to bywa, że i tu, do kuchni, sobie przyniosę, wstawię świece i patrzę, jak się palą. I gdy tak patrzę, jak się pa​lą, powiem panu, przestaję odczuwać, że to ja patrzę. Jakby ktoś tu był za mnie. Nie wiem kto. Zresztą nieważne. Psy leżą, o, jak teraz pod ścianami w mroku, śpią czy udają, a we mnie jakby wszystko mijało i coraz większy spokój mnie ogarnia. Obojętny się niemal sobie staję, obojętny staje mi się cały świat, że jest taki, nie inny. A nawet mam poczucie, jakbym się odnajdywał w nie​znanym mi porządku. No, i widzi pan, wydawałoby się zwykłe świece. Palą się i milczą. Ale może w tym ich milczeniu jest coś więcej prócz milczenia, jak pan myśli?

Może nawet wystarczyłoby to jedno zdanie. Bo kto wie, czy w tym jednym zdaniu nie powiedzieliby sobie tego, czego nie po​wiedzieli przez te wszystkie lata. O, w jednym zdaniu może się dużo zmieścić. Może się wszystko zmieścić. Może się całe życie zmieścić. Zdanie jest wymiarem świata, powiedział filozof. Tak, on. Czasem sobie myślę, czy nie dlatego tyle słów musimy przez życie powiedzieć, aby się mogło z nich wytopić to jedno zda​nie. Jakie? Każdemu jego własne. Które mógłby człowiek w przy​pływie rozpaczy powiedzieć i nie skłamałby. Przynajmniej wo​bec siebie.

– Ach, tak. Pamiętam cię ze stołówki. Podobałeś mi się. By​łeś taki nieśmiały, pamiętam. Chciałeś, żebym została twoją żo​ną, wiem. Wielu chciało. Zaskoczyła mnie, nigdy jej tego nie powiedziałem. I miałem zamiar powiedzieć, że nie tylko chciałem, i teraz chcę, żeby zo​stała. Może pan nie uwierzy, ale poczułem nagle coś takiego, jak​bym zapragnął znaleźć się z nią razem w tym jej nieszczęściu. Prawdziwa miłość jest raną. I tylko tak ją można odnaleźć w so​bie, gdy czyjś ból boli człowieka jako jego ból.

Jaki kolor? No, nie wiem. Zaskoczył mnie pan. Nie mam ulubionego kolom. I czyby to cokolwiek znaczyło, gdybym powiedział na przykład zielony? Bo jakiż to jest zielony? Każde drzewo w lesie, każdy krzak, każdy listek, nawet mech są inaczej zielone. I to wszyst​ko przemienia się i w panu w jeszcze inną zieloność. Czy można więc powiedzieć, że coś jest zielone? Zielone to nieskończoność. Każdy kolor nieskończoność. Gdy patrzyłem przez tę szparę w drzwiczkach, zdumiewało mnie, jak jedna białość przemienia się w inną białość, po chwili w inną i nigdy już do poprzedniej nie wraca. Jakby fale białości napływały na ten biały śnieg. To jaki, według pana, byłby kolor biały? Bawi się pan ze mną. Chciałby mnie pan całe życie widzieć w piaskownicy. Też bym wolał. Tylko że żaden kolor nie jest raz na zawsze. Kolor to ruch, jak wszystko. Za granicą odwiedzałem czasem galerie, muzea. Też pan od​wiedzał? To musiał pan zauważyć, że u każdego malarza najtrud​niejszym kolorem jest ciało kobiety. Nawet u tego samego na tym i na tym obrazie. Nie chodzi mi o to, że kolor się zmieniał, tyj ko jakby bezradność wobec tego koloru się ujawniała. Czy moż​na zatem powiedzieć, że ciało kobiety ma taki czy taki kolor? Skoro ten kolor może zależeć, dajmy na to, od zwątpienia ma​larza w siebie? Czy od jego lęku, cierpienia, rozpaczy. Tak, tak​że pożądania. Patrząc na te obrazy, miałem nieraz wrażenie, jak​by wszystkie te kolory nie były w stanie czemuś sprostać. Nie, nie modelowi, jak pan myśli. Czemu? To musi pan już sam sobie do​powiedzieć, jeśli miał pan kobiety.

Na tego, dajmy na to, który wie, że umrze, i tego, który nie dopuszcza myśli, że to on, tylko jakby ktoś drugi miał umrzeć za niego. I nigdy nie udaje mi się choćby na tyle być razem, aby przynajmniej w jedności sobie współczuć. Powiem panu, człowiek nie powinien nad sobą rozmyś​lać, a tym bardziej w sobie drążyć.

Według mnie miłość to niedosyt istnienia. A my byli​śmy obolali istnieniem. Nie byliśmy oboje już młodzi. Ona, co prawda, była kilka lat ode mnie młodsza, ale upłynęło już sporo, odkąd przestała być młoda. Musiałem ją nieraz prosić, żeby nie wstydziła się swojego ciała. Zawsze z lękiem spoglądała, czy na nią patrzę, kiedy się rozbierała. Zawsze było: – Zgaś światło. – Dlaczego? – Zgaś, proszę cię. – Ale dlaczego? – Nie rozumiesz? Nie rozumiałem. Nie podejrzewała zapewne, że gdy patrzy​łem na nią, jak się rozbierała, czułem coś takiego, jakbym sta​wał się bogatszy o wszystkie jej obolałości, o jej cierpienia, o jej przemijanie. Też wiele przeżyłem, lecz nie było to dla mnie takie ważne jak to, czym ona była naznaczona. Nie, nie o to chodzi, że współcierpiałem z nią. Czy zresztą miłość potrzebuje współcierpienia? Chodzi mi o to, że odczuwałem jej istnienie jako moje istnienie. Pyta pan, co to znaczy? To, że jakby pan całe brzemię czyjegoś istnienia pragnął wziąć na siebie. Jakby pan pragnął tego kogoś w ogóle zwolnić z konieczności istnienia. Jakby pan prag​nął za tego kogoś także umrzeć, żeby on nie musiał doświadczać swojego umierania. A to coś innego niż współcierpienie, jak się je na ogół rozumie. Na samą taką, choćby wyobrażoną, możliwość czułem, że chce mi się znowu żyć. Mówi pan, że to niemożliwe. Możliwe, że niemożliwe. Tylko wobec tego co powinno być mia​rą miłości? Jeśli pod tym nic nie znaczącym słowem pan i ja to samo byśmy rozumieli? Według czego mielibyśmy ją odczuwać? Według pożądania ciała? Ciało ma swój kres i dużo, dużo wcześ​niej, nim śmierć przyjdzie. Nie

Wobec natłoku wrażeń, których nie rozumie, człowiek normalnie myślący wzrusza ramionami, mówiąc: „W ogóle nie zwracaj na to uwagi!”, tak jakby to była oczywistość, bo dla niego sprawa jest ewidentna. Wystarczy po prostu, że nie zwróci na coś uwagi. Ludzie normalnie myślący nie zdają sobie sprawy z tego, co przeżywa nadwydajny mentalnie.

Ale w wielu sytuacjach stresowych ucieczka lub walka są niemożliwe lub niewskazane. W takim wypadku ciało migdałowate na próżno wpada w panikę i następuje przegrzanie. Ośrodki nerwowe w korze mózgowej, które powinny analizować i powściągać reakcje, nie odczytują prawidłowo sygnałów alarmowych. Aby podwyższone napięcie w ciele migdałowatym nie doprowadziło do śmierci wskutek zatrzymania akcji serca lub zatrucia neuronalnego kortyzolem, mózg wywołuje coś w rodzaju krótkiego spięcia, wysyłając nowe substancje chemiczne: morfinę i ketaminę, które wyłączają system alarmowy. Gdy ciało migdałowate jest w ten sposób zdezaktywowane i obezwładnione, człowiek zostaje nagle odcięty od świata, unosi się jakby odłączony od swoich emocji. Stresująca sytuacja nadal trwa, ale dana osoba niczego już nie odczuwa, co napełnia ją wrażeniem całkowitej nierealności chwili teraźniejszej. Nazywa się to dysocjacją.

U ludzi nadwydajnych mentalnie odnotowano niezwykłą wrażliwość ciała migdałowatego i wyjątkowo niski próg reaktywności. Może to wynikać z faktu, że ciało migdałowate jest stale pobudzane przez hiperestezję i emocjonalność, a więc siłą rzeczy znajduje się w stanie ciągłego pogotowia. Wówczas przy każdym przeżyciu emocjonalnym następuje wyłączenie umysłu. Przestaje funkcjonować kora przedczołowa, ośrodek rozumowania, a więc racjonalnego myślenia. Refleksja staje się niemożliwa. W takim wypadku nadwydajni mentalnie mogą wypowiadać absurdalne słowa lub popełniać niedorzeczne czyny. Oni pierwsi będą nad tym ubolewać, gdy płat przedczołowy znów zacznie normalnie działać.

Wywołuje stany euforii i napady przygnębienia, równie gwałtowne jak nieoczekiwane. Myślisz: „Byłoby wspaniale, gdyby…” i dajesz się ponieść fantazji, wyobrażając sobie dalszy ciąg. Nagle, w samym środku tych pozytywnych domniemywań, nie wiedzieć po co i dlaczego, zbaczasz z kursu: „Ale przede wszystkim nie należy…” I, bach, popadasz w czarnowidztwo. Z tego powodu nadwydajnych mentalnie często myli się z ludźmi dotkniętymi psychozą maniakalno-depresyjną lub podejrzewa, że cierpią na chorobę dwubiegunową. Ich nastroje zmieniają się tak szybko i radykalnie! Ponadto myśl biegnie błyskawicznie, toteż dana osoba przeważnie nie potrafi wyjaśnić, co sprawiło, że znienacka przeszła od śmiechu do płaczu.

Jestem pewna, że znaczna część ludzi cierpiących na chroniczną depresję to ci, których mózg wyczerpuje się, pracując na jałowym biegu, zasilany jedynie bezproduktywnymi obsesyjnymi myślami. Można by niemal użyć określenia „anoreksja” lub „niedożywienie intelektualne”. Dlatego myślę, że jeśli ktoś nadwydajny mentalnie szuka wszelkich sposobów, by czuć się użytecznym, mieć jakieś zajęcie i wykorzystywać swoje zdolności intelektualne, dostarcza tym samym dobrego ziarna umysłowi i dzięki temu może wyleczyć się z depresji.

Petrov froze in his chair. It was down to him: report the alert, and send the world into almost certain nuclear war; or wait, ignoring protocol, knowing that with every second that passed his country’s leaders had less time to launch a counter-strike. Fortunately for all of us, Petrov chose the latter. He had no way of knowing for sure that the alarm had sounded in error, but after 23 minutes – which must have felt like an eternity at the time – when it was clear that no nuclear missiles had landed on Russian soil, he finally knew that he had been correct. The algorithm had made a mistake.

Doing so sent the train full of people over the drop to crash straight into the stranded extra carriage. The result was horrendous. Several people suffered devastating injuries and two teenage girls lost their legs. Both of these life-or-death scenarios, Alton Towers and Petrov’s alarm, serve as dramatic illustrations of a much deeper dilemma.

She’d been shopping online and seen condoms among her list of ‘My Favourites’. They couldn’t be her husband’s, she explained, because he didn’t use them. At her request, the Tesco analysts looked into the data and discovered that her list was accurate. However, rather than be the cause of a marital rift, they took the diplomatic decision to apologize for ‘corrupted data’ and remove the offending items from her favourites.

In theory, they will no longer be allowed to store your data without an explicit purpose. They won’t be able to infer information about you without your consent. And they won’t be able to get your permission to collect your data for one reason, and then secretly use it for another. That doesn’t necessarily mean the end of these kinds of practices, however. For one thing, we often don’t pay attention to the T&Cs when we’re clicking around online, so we may find ourselves consenting without realizing.

This is quite a conundrum. However you set up the system for your judges, you have to find a tricky balance between offering individualized justice and ensuring consistency. Most countries have tried to solve the dilemma by settling on a system that falls somewhere between the prescriptive extreme of US federal law and one based almost entirely on judges’ discretion – like that used in Scotland.14 Across the Western world, sentencing guidelines tend to lay down a maximum sentence (as in Ireland) or a minimum sentence (as in Canada) or both (as in England and Wales),15 and allow judges latitude to adjust the sentence up or down between those limits. No system is perfect. There is always a muddle of competing unfairnesses, a chaos of opposing injustices. But in all this conflict and complexity an algorithm has a chance of coming into its own. Because – remarkably – with an algorithm as part of the process, both consistency and individualized justice can be guaranteed. No one needs to choose between them. The

And yet, if you build more than one tree – everything can change. Rather than using all the data at once, there is a way to divide and conquer. In what is known as an ensemble, you first build thousands of smaller trees from random subsections of the data. Then, when presented with a new defendant, you simply ask every tree to vote on whether it thinks awarding bail is a good idea or not. The trees may not all agree, and on their own they might still make weak predictions, but just by taking the average of all their answers, you can dramatically improve the precision of your predictions. It’s a bit like asking the audience in Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? A room full of strangers will be right more often than the cleverest person you know. (The ‘ask the audience’ lifeline had a 91 per cent success rate compared to just 65 per cent for ‘phone a friend’.?)21 The errors made by many can cancel each other out and result in a crowd that’s wiser than the individual. The same applies to the big group of decision trees which, taken together, make up a random forest (pun intended). Because the algorithm’s predictions are based on the patterns it learns from the data, a random forest is described as a machine-learning algorithm, which comes under the broader umbrella of artificial intelligence. (The term ‘machine learning’ first came up in the ‘Power’ chapter, and we’ll meet many more algorithms under this particular canopy later, but for now it’s worth noting how grand that description makes it sound, when the algorithm is essentially the flowcharts you used to draw at school, wrapped up in a bit of mathematical manipulation.) Random forests have proved themselves to be incredibly useful in a whole host of real-world applications. They’re used by Netflix to help predict what you’d like to watch based on past preferences;22

The effect of increasing the volume on your stereo by one level diminishes the louder it plays; a price hike from £1.20 to £2.20 feels enormous, but an increase from £67 to £68 doesn’t seem to matter; and time seems to speed up as you get older. It happens because humans’ senses work in relative terms rather than in absolute values. We don’t perceive each year as a fixed period of time; we experience each new year as a smaller and smaller fraction of the life we’ve lived. The size of the chunks of time or money or volume we perceive follows a very simple mathematical expression known as Weber’s Law.

An algorithm that works without our knowing how it makes its decisions might sound like witchcraft, but it might not be all that dissimilar from how we learn ourselves. Consider this comparison. One team recently trained an algorithm to distinguish between photos of wolves and pet huskies. They then showed how, thanks to the way it had tuned its own dials, the algorithm wasn’t using anything to do with the dogs as clues at all. It was basing its answer on whether the picture had snow in the background. Snow: wolf. No snow: husky.13 Shortly after their paper was published, I was chatting with Frank Kelly, a professor of mathematics at Cambridge University, who told me about a conversation he’d had with his grandson. He was walking the four-year-old to nursery when they passed a husky. His grandson remarked that the dog ‘looked like’ a wolf. When Frank asked how he knew that it wasn’t a wolf, he replied, ‘Because it’s on a lead.’

The good news, though, is that we’re not asking them to. Instead, the intention is to combine the strengths of human and machine. The algorithm does the donkey-work of searching the enormous amount of information in the slides, highlighting a few key areas of interest. Then the pathologist takes over. It doesn’t matter if the machine is flagging cells that aren’t cancerous; the human expert can quickly check through and eliminate anything that’s normal. This kind of algorithmic pre-screening partnership not only saves a lot of time, it also bumps up the overall accuracy of diagnosis to a stunning 99.5 per cent.18

Fast-forward 130 years and you might just recognize some similarities in the current trend for genetic testing. For the bargain price of £149, you can send off a saliva sample to the genomics and biotechnology company 23andMe in exchange for a report of your genetic traits, including answers to questions such as: What kind of earwax do you have? Do you have the genes for a monobrow?53 Or the gene that makes you sneeze when you look at the sun?54 As well as some more serious ones: Are you prone to breast cancer? Do you have a genetic predisposition for Alzheimer’s disease?55 The company, meanwhile, has cleverly amassed a gigantic database of genetic information, now stretching into the millions of samples. It’s just what the internet giants have been doing, except in handing over our DNA as part of the trade, we’re offering up the most personal data we have. The result is a database we all stand to benefit from. It constitutes a staggeringly valuable asset in terms of its potential to advance our understanding of the human genome. Academics, pharmaceutical companies and non-profits around the world are queuing up to partner with 23andMe to hunt for patterns in their data – both with and without the help of algorithms – in the hope of answering big questions that affect all of us: What are the hereditary causes of different diseases? Are there new drugs that could be invented to treat people with particular conditions? Is there a better way to treat Parkinson’s? The dataset is also valuable in a much more literal sense. Although the research being done offers an immense benefit to society, 23andMe isn’t doing this out of the goodness of its heart. If you give it your consent (and 80 per cent of customers do), it will sell on an anonymized version of your genetic data to those aforementioned research partners for a tidy profit.56 The money earned isn’t a happy bonus for the company; it’s actually their business plan. One 23andMe board member told Fast Company: ‘The long game here is not to make money selling kits, although the kits are essential to get the base level data.’ Something worth remembering whenever you send off for a commercial genetic report: you’re not using the product; you are the product.57 Word of warning. I’d also be a bit wary of those promises of anonymity. In 2005 a young man,58 conceived through a completely anonymous sperm donor, managed to track down and identify his birth father by sending off a saliva swab to be analysed and picking up on clues in his own DNA code.59 Then in 2013 a group of academics, in a particularly famous paper, demonstrated that millions of people could potentially be identified by their genes using nothing more than a home computer and a few clever internet searches.60

Imagine, for instance, you go into the doctor with a particularly annoying cough. You’ll probably get better on your own, but if a machine were serving you – the patient – it might want to send you for an X-ray and a blood test, just to be on the safe side. And it would probably give you antibiotics too, if you asked for them. Even if they only shortened your suffering by a few days, if the sole objective was your health and comfort, the algorithm might decide it was worth the prescription. But if a machine were built to serve the entire population, it would be far more mindful of the issues around antibiotic resistance. As long as you weren’t in immediate danger, your temporary discomfort would pale into insignificance and the algorithm would only dole out the drugs when absolutely necessary. An algorithm like this might also be wary of wasting resources or conscious of long waiting lists, and so not send you for further tests unless you had other symptoms of something more serious. Frankly, it would probably tell you to take some aspirin and stop being such a wimp.

It worked brilliantly at first. After training, ALVINN was able to comfortably navigate a simple road on its own. But then ALVINN came across a bridge and it all went wrong. Suddenly, the car swerved dangerously, and Pomerleau had to grab hold of the wheel to save it from crashing. After weeks of going through the data from the incident, Pomerleau worked out what the issue had been: the roads that ALVINN had been trained on had all had grass running along the sides. Just like those neural networks back in the ‘Medicine’ chapter, which classified huskies on the basis of snow in the pictures, ALVINN’s neural network had used the grass as a key indicator of where to drive. As soon as the grass was gone, the machine had no idea what to do.

Imagine you’re sitting with your back to a square table. Without you seeing, I throw a red ball on to the table. Your job is to guess where it landed. It’s not going to be easy: with no information to go on, there’s no real way of knowing where on the table it could be. So, to help your guess, I throw a second ball of a different colour on to the same table. Your job is still to determine the location of the first ball, the red one, but this time I’ll tell you where the second ball ends up on the table relative to the first: whether it’s in front, behind, to the left or right of the red ball. And you get to update your guess. Then we repeat. I throw a third, a fourth, a fifth ball on to the table, and every time I’ll tell you where each one lands relative to the very first red one – the one whose position you’re trying to guess. The more balls I throw and the more information I give you, the clearer the picture of the red ball’s position should become in your mind. You’ll never be absolutely sure of exactly where it sits, but you can keep updating your belief about its position until you end up with an answer you’re confident in.

If you’ve ever been broken into twice within a short space of time, you’ll be all too familiar with the boost effect. As police will tell you after you’ve first been victimized, criminals tend to repeatedly target the same location – and that means that no matter where you live, you’re most at risk in the days right after you’ve just been burgled. In fact, your chances of being targeted can increase twelvefold at this time.25 There are a few reasons why burglars might decide to return to your house. Perhaps they’ve got to know its layout, or where you keep your valuables (things like TVs and computers are often replaced pretty quickly, too), or the locks on your doors, or the local escape routes; or it might be that they spotted a big-ticket item they couldn’t carry the first time round. Whatever the reason, this boost effect doesn’t just apply to you. Researchers have found that the chances of your neighbours being burgled immediately after you will also be boosted, as will those of your neighbours’ neighbours, and your neighbours’ neighbours’ neighbours, and so on all the way down the street.

But on the other hand, it’s rather rare for everyone to agree. Other philosophers, such as David Hume, argue that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Consider the work of Andy Warhol, for instance, which offers a powerful aesthetic experience to some, while others find it artistically indistinguishable from a tin of soup. Others still, Immanuel Kant among them, have said the truth is something in between. That our judgements of beauty are not wholly subjective, nor can they be entirely objective. They are sensory, emotional and intellectual all at once – and, crucially, can change over time depending on the state of mind of the observer.

The first step in building the algorithm was to translate Bach’s music into something that can be understood by a machine: ‘You have to place into a database five representations of a single note: the on time, the duration, pitch, loudness and instrument.’ For each note in Bach’s back catalogue, Cope had to painstakingly enter these five numbers into a computer by hand. There were 371 Bach chorales alone, many harmonies, tens of thousands of notes, five numbers per note. It required a monumental effort from Cope: ‘For months, all I was doing every day was typing in numbers. But I’m a person who is nothing but obsessive.’ From there, Cope’s analysis took each beat in Bach’s music and examined what happened next. For every note that is played in a Bach chorale, Cope made a record of the next note. He stored everything together in a kind of dictionary – a bank in which the algorithm could look up a single chord and find an exhaustive list of all the different places Bach’s quill had sent the music next. In that sense, EMI has some similarities to the predictive text algorithms you’ll find on your smartphone. Based on the sentences you’ve written in the past, the phone keeps a dictionary of the words you’re likely to want to type next and brings them up as suggestions as you’re writing.fn4 The final step was to let the machine loose. Cope would seed the system with an initial chord and instruct the algorithm to look it up in the dictionary to decide what to play next, by selecting the new chord at random from the list. Then the algorithm repeats the process – looking up each subsequent chord in the dictionary to choose the next notes to play. The result was an entirely original composition that sounds just like Bach himself.fn5 Or maybe it is Bach himself. That’s Cope’s view, anyway. ‘Bach created all of the chords. It’s like taking Parmesan cheese and putting it through the grater, and then trying to put it back together again. It would still turn out to be Parmesan cheese.’

What was so special about the new Sapiens language that it enabled us to conquer the world?* It was not the first language. Every animal has some kind of language. Even insects, such as bees and ants, know how to communicate in sophisticated ways, informing one another of the whereabouts of food. Neither was it the first vocal language. Many animals, including all ape and monkey species, have vocal languages. For example, green monkeys use calls of various kinds to communicate. Zoologists have identified one call that means, ‘Careful! An eagle!’ A slightly different call warns, ‘Careful! A lion!’ When researchers played a recording of the first call to a group of monkeys, the monkeys stopped what they were doing and looked upwards in fear. When the same group heard a recording of the second call, the lion warning, they quickly scrambled up a tree. Sapiens can produce many more distinct sounds than green monkeys, but whales and elephants have equally impressive abilities. A parrot can say anything Albert Einstein could say, as well as mimicking the sounds of phones ringing, doors slamming and sirens wailing. Whatever advantage Einstein had over a parrot, it wasn’t vocal. What, then, is so special about our language? The most common answer is that our language is amazingly supple. We can connect a limited number of sounds and signs to produce an infinite number of sentences, each with a distinct meaning. We can thereby ingest, store and communicate a prodigious amount of information about the surrounding world. A green monkey can yell to its comrades, ‘Careful! A lion!’ But a modern human can tell her friends that this morning, near the bend in the river, she saw a lion tracking a herd of bison. She can then describe the exact location, including the different paths leading to the area. With this information, the members of her band can put their heads together and discuss whether they ought to approach the river in order to chase away the lion and hunt the bison. A second theory agrees that our unique language evolved as a means of sharing information about the world. But the most important information that needed to be conveyed was about humans, not about lions and bison. Our language evolved as a way of gossiping. According to this theory Homo sapiens is primarily a social animal. Social cooperation is our key for survival and reproduction. It is not enough for individual men and women to know the whereabouts of lions and bison. It’s much more important for them to know who in their band hates whom, who is sleeping with whom, who is honest, and who is a cheat. 4.

But fiction has enabled us not merely to imagine things, but to do so collectively. We can weave common myths such as the biblical creation story, the Dreamtime myths of Aboriginal Australians, and the nationalist myths of modern states. Such myths give Sapiens the unprecedented ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers. Ants and bees can also work together in huge numbers, but they do so in a very rigid manner and only with close relatives. Wolves and chimpanzees cooperate far more flexibly than ants, but they can do so only with small numbers of other individuals that they know intimately. Sapiens can cooperate in extremely flexible ways with countless numbers of strangers.

A small family business can survive and flourish without a board of directors, a CEO or an accounting department. But once the threshold of 150 individuals is crossed, things can no longer work that way. You cannot run a division with thousands of soldiers the same way you run a platoon. Successful family businesses usually face a crisis when they grow larger and hire more personnel. If they cannot reinvent themselves, they go bust. How did Homo sapiens manage to cross this critical threshold, eventually founding cities comprising tens of thousands of inhabitants and empires ruling hundreds of millions? The secret was probably the appearance of fiction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths.

Peugeot belongs to a particular genre of legal fictions called ‘limited liability companies’. The idea behind such companies is among humanity’s most ingenious inventions. Homo sapiens lived for untold millennia without them. During most of recorded history property could be owned only by flesh-and-blood humans, the kind that stood on two legs and had big brains. If in thirteenth-century France Jean set up a wagon-manufacturing workshop, he himself was the business. If a wagon he’d made broke down a week after purchase, the disgruntled buyer would have sued Jean personally. If Jean had borrowed 1,000 gold coins to set up his workshop and the business failed, he would have had to repay the loan by selling his private property – his house, his cow, his land. He might even have had to sell his children into servitude. If he couldn’t cover the debt, he could be thrown in prison by the state or enslaved by his creditors. He was fully liable, without limit, for all obligations incurred by his workshop. If you had lived back then, you would probably have thought twice before you opened an enterprise of your own. And indeed this legal situation discouraged entrepreneurship. People were afraid to start new businesses and take economic risks. It hardly seemed worth taking the chance that their families could end up utterly destitute. This is why people began collectively to imagine the existence of limited liability companies. Such companies were legally independent of the people who set them up, or invested money in them, or managed them. Over the last few centuries such companies have become the main players in the economic arena, and we have grown so used to them that we forget they exist only in our imagination. In the US, the technical term for a limited liability company is a ‘corporation’, which is ironic, because the term derives from ‘corpus’ (‘body’ in Latin) – the one thing these corporations lack. Despite their having no real bodies, the American legal system treats corporations as legal persons, as if they were flesh-and-blood human beings.

To that end, he set up a limited liability company. He named the company after himself, but it was independent of him. If one of the cars broke down, the buyer could sue Peugeot, but not Armand Peugeot. If the company borrowed millions of francs and then went bust, Armand Peugeot did not owe its creditors a single franc.

The behaviour of other social animals is determined to a large extent by their genes. DNA is not an autocrat. Animal behaviour is also influenced by environmental factors and individual quirks. Nevertheless, in a given environment, animals of the same species will tend to behave in a similar way. Significant changes in social behaviour cannot occur, in general, without genetic mutations. For example, common chimpanzees have a genetic tendency to live in hierarchical groups headed by an alpha male. Members of a closely related chimpanzee species, bonobos, usually live in more egalitarian groups dominated by female alliances. Female common chimpanzees cannot take lessons from their bonobo relatives and stage a feminist revolution. Male chimps cannot gather in a constitutional assembly to abolish the office of alpha male and declare that from here on out all chimps are to be treated as equals. Such dramatic changes in behaviour would occur only if something changed in the chimpanzees’ DNA. For similar reasons, archaic humans did not initiate any revolutions. As far as we can tell, changes in social patterns, the invention of new technologies and the settlement of alien habitats resulted from genetic mutations and environmental pressures more than from cultural initiatives.

The flourishing field of evolutionary psychology argues that many of our present-day social and psychological characteristics were shaped during this long pre-agricultural era. Even today, scholars in this field claim, our brains and minds are adapted to a life of hunting and gathering. Our eating habits, our conflicts and our sexuality are all the result of the way our hunter-gatherer minds interact with our current post-industrial environment, with its mega-cities, aeroplanes, telephones and computers. This environment gives us more material resources and longer lives than those enjoyed by any previous generation, but it often makes us feel alienated, depressed and pressured. To understand why, evolutionary psychologists argue, we need to delve into the hunter-gatherer world that shaped us, the world that we subconsciously still inhabit.

Why, for example, do people gorge on high-calorie food that is doing little good to their bodies? Today’s affluent societies are in the throes of a plague of obesity, which is rapidly spreading to developing countries. It’s a puzzle why we binge on the sweetest and greasiest food we can find, until we consider the eating habits of our forager forebears. In the savannahs and forests they inhabited, high-calorie sweets were extremely rare and food in general was in short supply. A typical forager 30,000 years ago had access to only one type of sweet food – ripe fruit. If a Stone Age woman came across a tree groaning with figs, the most sensible thing to do was to eat as many of them as she could on the spot, before the local baboon band picked the tree bare. The instinct to gorge on high-calorie food was hard-wired into our genes. Today we may be living in high-rise apartments with over-stuffed refrigerators, but our DNA still thinks we are in the savannah. That’s what makes us spoon down an entire tub of Ben & Jerry’s when we find one in the freezer and wash it down with a jumbo Coke. This ‘gorging gene’ theory is widely accepted.

Such a social structure is not an Aquarian utopia. It’s well documented among animals, notably our closest relatives, the chimpanzees and bonobos. There are even a number of present-day human cultures in which collective fatherhood is practised, as for example among the Barí Indians. According to the beliefs of such societies, a child is not born from the sperm of a single man, but from the accumulation of sperm in a woman’s womb. A good mother will make a point of having sex with several different men, especially when she is pregnant, so that her child will enjoy the qualities (and paternal care) not merely of the best hunter, but also of the best storyteller, the strongest warrior and the most considerate lover. If this sounds silly, bear in mind that before the development of modern embryological studies, people had no solid evidence that babies are always sired by a single father rather than by many. The proponents of this ‘ancient commune’ theory argue that the frequent infidelities that characterise modern marriages, and the high rates of divorce, not to mention the cornucopia of psychological complexes from which both children and adults suffer, all result from forcing humans to live in nuclear families and monogamous relationships that are incompatible with our biological software.1 Many scholars vehemently reject this theory, insisting that both monogamy and the forming of nuclear families are core human behaviours. Though ancient hunter-gatherer societies tended to be more communal and egalitarian than modern societies, these researchers argue, they were nevertheless comprised of separate cells, each containing a jealous couple and the children they held in common. This is why today monogamous relationships and nuclear families are the norm in the vast majority of cultures, why men and women tend to be very possessive of their partners and children, and why even in modern states such as North Korea and Syria political authority passes from father to son.

There was just one exception to this general rule: the dog. The dog was the first animal domesticated by Homo sapiens, and this occurred before the Agricultural Revolution. Experts disagree about the exact date, but we have incontrovertible evidence of domesticated dogs from about 15,000 years ago. They may have joined the human pack thousands of years earlier. Dogs were used for hunting and fighting, and as an alarm system against wild beasts and human intruders. With the passing of generations, the two species co-evolved to communicate well with each other. Dogs that were most attentive to the needs and feelings of their human companions got extra care and food, and were more likely to survive. Simultaneously, dogs learned to manipulate people for their own needs. A 15,000-year bond has yielded a much deeper understanding and affection between humans and dogs than between humans and any other animal.4 In some cases dead dogs were even buried ceremoniously, much like humans.

Who was responsible? Neither kings, nor priests, nor merchants. The culprits were a handful of plant species, including wheat, rice and potatoes. These plants domesticated Homo sapiens, rather than vice versa. Think for a moment about the Agricultural Revolution from the viewpoint of wheat. Ten thousand years ago wheat was just a wild grass, one of many, confined to a small range in the Middle East. Suddenly, within just a few short millennia, it was growing all over the world. According to the basic evolutionary criteria of survival and reproduction, wheat has become one of the most successful plants in the history of the earth. In areas such as the Great Plains of North America, where not a single wheat stalk grew 10,000 years ago, you can today walk for hundreds upon hundreds of kilometres without encountering any other plant. Worldwide, wheat covers about 2.25 million square kilometres of the globes surface, almost ten times the size of Britain. How did this grass turn from insignificant to ubiquitous? Wheat did it by manipulating Homo sapiens to its advantage. This ape had been living a fairly comfortable life hunting and gathering until about 10,000 years ago, but then began to invest more and more effort in cultivating wheat. Within a couple of millennia, humans in many parts of the world were doing little from dawn to dusk other than taking care of wheat plants. It wasn’t easy. Wheat demanded a lot of them. Wheat didn’t like rocks and pebbles, so Sapiens broke their backs clearing fields. Wheat didn’t like sharing its space, water and nutrients with other plants, so men and women laboured long days weeding under the scorching sun. Wheat got sick, so Sapiens had to keep a watch out for worms and blight. Wheat was defenceless against other organisms that liked to eat it, from rabbits to locust swarms, so the farmers had to guard and protect it. Wheat was thirsty, so humans lugged water from springs and streams to water it. Its hunger even impelled Sapiens to collect animal faeces to nourish the ground in which wheat grew. The body of Homo sapiens had not evolved for such tasks. It was adapted to climbing apple trees and running after gazelles, not to clearing rocks and carrying water buckets. Human spines, knees, necks and arches paid the price. Studies of ancient skeletons indicate that the transition to agriculture brought about a plethora of ailments, such as slipped discs, arthritis and hernias. Moreover, the new agricultural tasks demanded so much time that people were forced to settle permanently next to their wheat fields. This completely changed their way of life. We did not domesticate wheat. It domesticated us. The word ‘domesticate’ comes from the Latin domus, which means ‘house’. Who’s the one living in a house? Not the wheat. It’s the Sapiens.

Previously it took a lot of work to write a letter, address and stamp an envelope, and take it to the mailbox. It took days or weeks, maybe even months, to get a reply. Nowadays I can dash off an email, send it halfway around the globe, and (if my addressee is online) receive a reply a minute later. I’ve saved all that trouble and time, but do I live a more relaxed life? Sadly not. Back in the snail-mail era, people usually only wrote letters when they had something important to relate. Rather than writing the first thing that came into their heads, they considered carefully what they wanted to say and how to phrase it. They expected to receive a similarly considered answer. Most people wrote and received no more than a handful of letters a month and seldom felt compelled to reply immediately.

The vast majority of farmers lived in permanent settlements; only a few were nomadic shepherds. Settling down caused most peoples turf to shrink dramatically. Ancient hunter-gatherers usually lived in territories covering many dozens and even hundreds of square kilometres. ‘Home’ was the entire territory, with its hills, streams, woods and open sky. Peasants, on the other hand, spent most of their days working a small field or orchard, and their domestic lives centred on a cramped structure of wood, stone or mud, measuring no more than a few dozen metres – the house. The typical peasant developed a very strong attachment to this structure. This was a far-reaching revolution, whose impact was psychological as much as architectural. Henceforth, attachment to ‘my house’ and separation from the neighbours became the psychological hallmark of a much more self-centred creature.

The Agricultural Revolution made the future far more important than it had ever been before. Farmers must always keep the future in mind and must work in its service. The agricultural economy was based on a seasonal cycle of production, comprising long months of cultivation followed by short peak periods of harvest. On the night following the end of a plentiful harvest the peasants might celebrate for all they were worth, but within a week or so they were again up at dawn for a long day in the field. Although there was enough food for today, next week, and even next month, they had to worry about next year and the year after that. Concern about the future was rooted not only in seasonal cycles of production, but also in the fundamental uncertainty of agriculture. Since most villages lived by cultivating a very limited variety of domesticated plants and animals, they were at the mercy of droughts, floods and pestilence. Peasants were obliged to produce more than they consumed so that they could build up reserves. Without grain in the silo, jars of olive oil in the cellar, cheese in the pantry and sausages hanging from the rafters, they would starve in bad years. And bad years were bound to come, sooner or later. A peasant living on the assumption that bad years would not come didn’t live long. Consequently, from the very advent of agriculture, worries about the future became major players in the theatre of the human mind. Where farmers depended on rains to water their fields, the onset of the rainy season meant that each morning the farmers gazed towards the horizon, sniffing the wind and straining their eyes. Is that a cloud? Would the rains come on time? Would there be enough? Would violent storms wash the seeds from the fields and batter down seedlings? Meanwhile, in the valleys of the Euphrates, Indus and Yellow rivers, other peasants monitored, with no less trepidation, the height of the water. They needed the rivers to rise in order to spread the fertile topsoil washed down from the highlands, and to enable their vast irrigation systems to fill with water. But floods that surged too high or came at the wrong time could destroy their fields as much as a drought. Peasants were worried about the future not just because they had more cause for worry, but also because they could do something about it. They could clear another field, dig another irrigation canal, sow more crops. The anxious peasant was as frenetic and hardworking as a harvester ant in the summer, sweating to plant olive trees whose oil would be pressed by his children and grandchildren, putting off until the winter or the following year the eating of the food he craved today. The stress of farming had far-reaching consequences. It was the foundation of large-scale political and social systems. Sadly, the diligent peasants almost never achieved the future economic security they so craved through their hard work in the present. Everywhere, rulers and elites sprang up, living off the peasants’ surplus food and leaving them with only a bare subsistence. These forfeited food surpluses fuelled politics, wars, art and philosophy. They built palaces, forts, monuments and temples. Until the late modern era, more than 90 per cent of humans were peasants who rose each morning to till the land by the sweat of their brows. The extra they produced fed the tiny minority of elites – kings, government officials, soldiers, priests, artists and thinkers – who fill the history books. History is something that very few people have been doing while everyone else was ploughing fields and carrying water buckets.

An even more interesting question concerns those standing at the top of the social pyramid. Why should they wish to enforce an imagined order if they themselves don’t believe in it? It is quite common to argue that the elite may do so out of cynical greed. Yet a cynic who believes in nothing is unlikely to be greedy. It does not take much to provide the objective biological needs of Homo sapiens. After those needs are met, more money can be spent on building pyramids, taking holidays around the world, financing election campaigns, funding your favourite terrorist organisation, or investing in the stock market and making yet more money – all of which are activities that a true cynic would find utterly meaningless. Diogenes, the Greek philosopher who founded the Cynical school, lived in a barrel. When Alexander the Great once visited Diogenes as he was relaxing in the sun, and asked if there were anything he might do for him, the Cynic answered the all-powerful conqueror, ‘Yes, there is something you can do for me. Please move a little to the side. You are blocking the sunlight.’ This is why cynics don’t build empires and why an imagined order can be maintained only if large segments of the population – and in particular large segments of the elite and the security forces – truly believe in it. Christianity would not have lasted 2,000 years if the majority of bishops and priests failed to believe in Christ. American democracy would not have lasted 250 years if the majority of presidents and congressmen failed to believe in human rights. The modern economic system would not have lasted a single day if the majority of investors and bankers failed to believe in capitalism.

From the moment they are born, you constantly remind them of the principles of the imagined order, which are incorporated into anything and everything. They are incorporated into fairy tales, dramas, paintings, songs, etiquette, political propaganda, architecture, recipes and fashions. For example, today people believe in equality, so it’s fashionable for rich kids to wear jeans, which were originally working-class attire. In the Middle Ages people believed in class divisions, so no young nobleman would have worn a peasant’s smock. Back then, to be addressed as ‘Sir’ or ‘Madam’ was a rare privilege reserved for the nobility, and often purchased with blood. Today all polite correspondence, regardless of the recipient, begins with ‘Dear Sir or Madam’.

b. The imagined order shapes our desires. Most people do not wish to accept that the order governing their lives is imaginary, but in fact every person is born into a pre-existing imagined order, and his or her desires are shaped from birth by its dominant myths. Our personal desires thereby become the imagined order’s most important defences. For instance, the most cherished desires of present-day Westerners are shaped by romantic, nationalist, capitalist and humanist myths that have been around for centuries. Friends giving advice often tell each other, ‘Follow your heart.’ But the heart is a double agent that usually takes its instructions from the dominant myths of the day, and the very recommendation to ‘Follow your heart’ was implanted in our minds by a combination of nineteenth-century Romantic myths and twentieth-century consumerist myths. The Coca-Cola Company, for example, has marketed Diet Coke around the world under the slogan, ‘Diet Coke. Do what feels good.’ Even what people take to be their most personal desires are usually programmed by the imagined order. Let’s consider, for example, the popular desire to take a holiday abroad. There is nothing natural or obvious about this. A chimpanzee alpha male would never think of using his power in order to go on holiday into the territory of a neighbouring chimpanzee band. The elite of ancient Egypt spent their fortunes building pyramids and having their corpses mummified, but none of them thought of going shopping in Babylon or taking a skiing holiday in Phoenicia. People today spend a great deal of money on holidays abroad because they are true believers in the myths of romantic consumerism. Romanticism tells us that in order to make the most of our human potential we must have as many different experiences as we can. We must open ourselves to a wide spectrum of emotions; we must sample various kinds of relationships; we must try different cuisines; we must learn to appreciate different styles of music. One of the best ways to do all that is to break free from our daily routine, leave behind our familiar setting, and go travelling in distant lands, where we can ‘experience’ the culture, the smells, the tastes and the norms of other people. We hear again and again the romantic myths about ‘how a new experience opened my eyes and changed my life’. Consumerism tells us that in order to be happy we must consume as many products and services as possible. If we feel that something is missing or not quite right, then we probably need to buy a product (a car, new clothes, organic food) or a service (housekeeping, relationship therapy, yoga classes). Every television commercial is another little legend about how consuming some product or service will make life better. Romanticism, which encourages variety, meshes perfectly with consumerism. Their marriage has given birth to the infinite ‘market of experiences’, on which the modern tourism industry is founded. The tourism industry does not sell flight tickets and hotel bedrooms. It sells experiences. Paris is not a city, nor India a country – they are both experiences, the consumption of which is supposed to widen our horizons, fulfil our human potential, and make us happier. Consequently, when the relationship between a millionaire and his wife is going through a rocky patch, he takes her on an expensive trip to Paris. The trip is not a reflection of some independent desire, but rather of an ardent belief in the myths of romantic consumerism. A wealthy man in ancient Egypt would never have dreamed of solving a relationship crisis by taking his wife on holiday to Babylon. Instead, he might have built for her the sumptuous tomb she had always wanted.

The inter-subjective is something that exists within the communication network linking the subjective consciousness of many individuals. If a single individual changes his or her beliefs, or even dies, it is of little importance. However, if most individuals in the network die or change their beliefs, the inter-subjective phenomenon will mutate or disappear. Inter-subjective phenomena are neither malevolent frauds nor insignificant charades. They exist in a different way from physical phenomena such as radioactivity, but their impact on the world may still be enormous. Many of history’s most important drivers are inter-subjective: law, money, gods, nations.

The large societies found in some other species, such as ants and bees, are stable and resilient because most of the information needed to sustain them is encoded in the genome. A female honeybee larva can, for example, grow up to be either a queen or a worker, depending on what food it is fed. Its DNA programmes the necessary behaviours for whatever role it will fulfil in life. Hives can be very complex social structures, containing many different kinds of workers, such as harvesters, nurses and cleaners. But so far researchers have failed to locate lawyer bees. Bees don’t need lawyers, because there is no danger that they might forget or violate the hive constitution. The queen does not cheat the cleaner bees of their food, and they never go on strike demanding higher wages. But humans do such things all the time. Because the Sapiens social order is imagined, humans cannot preserve the critical information for running it simply by making copies of their DNA and passing these on to their progeny. A conscious effort has to be made to sustain laws, customs, procedures and manners, otherwise the social order would quickly collapse. For example, King Hammurabi decreed that people are divided into superiors, commoners and slaves. Unlike the beehive class system, this is not a natural division – there is no trace of it in the human genome. If the Babylonians could not keep this ‘truth’ in mind, their society would have ceased to function. Similarly, when Hammurabi passed his DNA to his offspring, it did not encode his ruling that a superior man who killed a commoner woman must pay thirty silver shekels. Hammurabi deliberately had to instruct his sons in the laws of his empire, and his sons and grandsons had to do the same.

Thirdly and most importantly, the human brain has been adapted to store and process only particular types of information. In order to survive, ancient hunter-gatherers had to remember the shapes, qualities and behaviour patterns of thousands of plant and animal species. They had to remember that a wrinkled yellow mushroom growing in autumn under an elm tree is most probably poisonous, whereas a similar-looking mushroom growing in winter under an oak tree is a good stomach-ache remedy. Hunter-gatherers also had to bear in mind the opinions and relations of several dozen band members. If Lucy needed a band member’s help to get John to stop harassing her, it was important for her to remember that John had fallen out last week with Mary, who would thus be a likely and enthusiastic ally. Consequently, evolutionary pressures have adapted the human brain to store immense quantities of botanical, zoological, topographical and social information. But when particularly complex societies began to appear in the wake of the Agricultural Revolution, a completely new type of information became vital – numbers.

The earliest Sumerian writing was a partial rather than a full script. Full script is a system of material signs that can represent spoken language more or less completely. It can therefore express everything people can say, including poetry. Partial script, on the other hand, is a system of material signs that can represent only particular types of information, belonging to a limited field of activity. Latin script, ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics and Braille are full scripts. You can use them to write tax registers, love poems, history books, food recipes and business law. In contrast, the earliest Sumerian script, like modern mathematical symbols and musical notation, are partial scripts. You can use mathematical script to make calculations, but you cannot use it to write love poems.

This partial script was composed of ten signs, representing the numbers from 0 to 9. Confusingly, these signs are known as Arabic numerals even though they were first invented by the Hindus (even more confusingly, modern Arabs use a set of digits that look quite different from Western ones). But the Arabs get the credit because when they invaded India they encountered the system, understood its usefulness, refined it, and spread it through the Middle East and then to Europe. When several other signs were later added to the Arab numerals (such as the signs for addition, subtraction and multiplication), the basis of modern mathematical notation came into being.

How can we distinguish what is biologically determined from what people merely try to justify through biological myths? A good rule of thumb is ‘Biology enables, Culture forbids.’ Biology is willing to tolerate a very wide spectrum of possibilities. It’s culture that obliges people to realise some possibilities while forbidding others. Biology enables women to have children – some cultures oblige women to realise this possibility. Biology enables men to enjoy sex with one another – some cultures forbid them to realise this possibility. Culture tends to argue that it forbids only that which is unnatural. But from a biological perspective, nothing is unnatural. Whatever is possible is by definition also natural. A truly unnatural behaviour, one that goes against the laws of nature, simply cannot exist, so it would need no prohibition. No culture has ever bothered to forbid men to photosynthesise, women to run faster than the speed of light, or negatively charged electrons to be attracted to each other.

In truth, our concepts ‘natural’ and unnatural’ are taken not from biology, but from Christian theology. The theological meaning of ‘natural’ is ‘in accordance with the intentions of the God who created nature’. Christian theologians argued that God created the human body, intending each limb and organ to serve a particular purpose. If we use our limbs and organs for the purpose envisioned by God, then it is a natural activity. To use them differently than God intends is unnatural. But evolution has no purpose. Organs have not evolved with a purpose, and the way they are used is in constant flux. There is not a single organ in the human body that only does the job its prototype did when it first appeared hundreds of millions of years ago. Organs evolve to perform a particular function, but once they exist, they can be adapted for other usages as well. Mouths, for example, appeared because the earliest multicellular organisms needed a way to take nutrients into their bodies. We still use our mouths for that purpose, but we also use them to kiss, speak and, if we are Rambo, to pull the pins out of hand grenades. Are any of these uses unnatural simply because our worm-like ancestors 600 million years ago didn’t do those things with their mouths?

Human cultures are in constant flux. Is this flux completely random, or does it have some overall pattern? In other words, does history have a direction? The answer is yes. Over the millennia, small, simple cultures gradually coalesce into bigger and more complex civilisations, so that the world contains fewer and fewer mega-cultures, each of which is bigger and more complex. This is of course a very crude generalisation, true only at the macro level. At the micro level, it seems that for every group of cultures that coalesces into a mega-culture, there’s a mega-culture that breaks up into pieces. The Mongol Empire expanded to dominate a huge swathe of Asia and even parts of Europe, only to shatter into fragments.

Since all social orders and hierarchies are imagined, they are all fragile, and the larger the society, the more fragile it is. The crucial historical role of religion has been to give superhuman legitimacy to these fragile structures. Religions assert that our laws are not the result of human caprice, but are ordained by an absolute and supreme authority. This helps place at least some fundamental laws beyond challenge, thereby ensuring social stability.

<blockquote>
Gautama grounded these meditation techniques in a set of ethical rules meant to make it easier for people to focus on actual experience and to avoid falling into cravings and fantasies. He instructed his followers to avoid killing, promiscuous sex and theft, since such acts necessarily stoke the fire of craving (for power, for sensual pleasure, or for wealth). When the flames are completely extinguished, craving is replaced by a state of perfect contentment and serenity, known as nirvana (the literal meaning of which is ‘extinguishing the fire’). Those who have attained nirvana are fully liberated from all suffering. They experience reality with the utmost clarity, free of fantasies and delusions. While they will most likely still encounter unpleasantness and pain, such experiences cause them no misery. A person who does not crave cannot suffer. According to Buddhist tradition, Gautama himself attained nirvana and was fully liberated from suffering. Henceforth he was known as ‘Buddha’, which means ‘The Enlightened One’. Buddha spent the rest of his life explaining his discoveries to others so that everyone could be freed from suffering. He encapsulated his teachings in a single law: suffering arises from craving; the only way to be fully liberated from suffering is to be fully liberated from craving; and the only way to be liberated from craving is to train the mind to experience reality as it is.

<blockquote>
The last 300 years are often depicted as an age of growing secularism, in which religions have increasingly lost their importance. If we are talking about theist religions, this is largely correct. But if we take into consideration natural-law religions, then modernity turns out to be an age of intense religious fervour, unparalleled missionary efforts, and the bloodiest wars of religion in history. The modern age has witnessed the rise of a number of new natural-law religions, such as liberalism, Communism, capitalism, nationalism and Nazism. These creeds do not like to be called religions, and refer to themselves as ideologies. But this is just a semantic exercise. If a religion is a system of human norms and values that is founded on belief in a superhuman order, then Soviet Communism was no less a religion than Islam.

Some readers may feel very uncomfortable with this line of reasoning. If it makes you feel better, you are free to go on calling Communism an ideology rather than a religion. It makes no difference. We can divide creeds into god-centred religions and godless ideologies that claim to be based on natural laws. But then, to be consistent, we would need to catalogue at least some Buddhist, Daoist and Stoic sects as ideologies rather than religions. Conversely, we should note that belief in gods persists within many modern ideologies, and that some of them, most notably liberalism, make little sense without this belief.

Level one chaos is chaos that does not react to predictions about it. The weather, for example, is a level one chaotic system. Though it is influenced by myriad factors, we can build computer models that take more and more of them into consideration, and produce better and better weather forecasts. Level two chaos is chaos that reacts to predictions about it, and therefore can never be predicted accurately. Markets, for example, are a level two chaotic system. What will happen if we develop a computer program that forecasts with 100 per cent accuracy the price of oil tomorrow? The price of oil will immediately react to the forecast, which would consequently fail to materialise. If the current price of oil is $90 a barrel, and the infallible computer program predicts that tomorrow it will be $100, traders will rush to buy oil so that they can profit from the predicted price rise. As a result, the price will shoot up to $100 a barrel today rather than tomorrow. Then what will happen tomorrow? Nobody knows. Politics, too, is a second-order chaotic system. Many people criticise Sovietologists for failing to predict the 1989 revolutions and castigate Middle East experts for not anticipating the Arab Spring revolutions of 2011. This is unfair. Revolutions are, by definition, unpredictable. A predictable revolution never erupts.

Ever more scholars see cultures as a kind of mental infection or parasite, with humans as its unwitting host. Organic parasites, such as viruses, live inside the body of their hosts. They multiply and spread from one host to the other, feeding off their hosts, weakening them, and sometimes even killing them. As long as the hosts live long enough to pass along the parasite, it cares little about the condition of its host. In just this fashion, cultural ideas live inside the minds of humans. They multiply and spread from one host to another, occasionally weakening the hosts and sometimes even killing them. A cultural idea – such as belief in Christian heaven above the clouds or Communist paradise here on earth – can compel a human to dedicate his or her life to spreading that idea, even at the price of death. The human dies, but the idea spreads. According to this approach, cultures are not conspiracies concocted by some people in order to take advantage of others (as Marxists tend to think). Rather, cultures are mental parasites that emerge accidentally, and thereafter take advantage of all people infected by them. This approach is sometimes called memetics. It assumes that, just as organic evolution is based on the replication of organic information units called ‘genes’, so cultural evolution is based on the replication of cultural information units called ‘memes’.1 Successful cultures are those that excel in reproducing their memes, irrespective of the costs and benefits to their human hosts.

Game theory explains how in multi-player systems, views and behaviour patterns that harm all players nevertheless manage to take root and spread. Arms races are a famous example. Many arms races bankrupt all those who take part in them, without really changing the military balance of power. When Pakistan buys advanced aeroplanes, India responds in kind. When India develops nuclear bombs, Pakistan follows suit. When Pakistan enlarges its navy, India counters. At the end of the process, the balance of power may remain much as it was, but meanwhile billions of dollars that could have been invested in education or health are spent on weapons. Yet the arms race dynamic is hard to resist. ‘Arms racing’ is a pattern of behaviour that spreads itself like a virus from one country to another, harming everyone, but benefiting itself, under the evolutionary criteria of survival and reproduction.

But the single most remarkable and defining moment of the past 500 years came at 05:29:45 on 16 July 1945. At that precise second, American scientists detonated the first atomic bomb at Alamogordo, New Mexico. From that point onward, humankind had the capability not only to change the course of history, but to end it. The historical process that led to Alamogordo and to the moon is known as the Scientific Revolution. During this revolution humankind has obtained enormous new powers by investing resources in scientific research. It is a revolution because, until about AD 1500, humans the world over doubted their ability to obtain new medical, military and economic powers. While government and wealthy patrons allocated funds to education and scholarship, the aim was, in general, to preserve existing capabilities rather than acquire new ones. The typical premodern ruler gave money to priests, philosophers and poets in the hope that they would legitimise his rule and maintain the social order. He did not expect them to discover new medications, invent new weapons or stimulate economic growth. During the last five centuries, humans increasingly came to believe that they could increase their capabilities by investing in scientific research. This wasn’t just blind faith – it was repeatedly proven empirically. The more proofs there were, the more resources wealthy people and governments were willing to put into science. We would never have been able to walk on the moon, engineer microorganisms and split the atom without such investments. The US government, for example, has in recent decades allocated billions of dollars to the study of nuclear physics. The knowledge produced by this research has made possible the construction of nuclear power stations, which provide cheap electricity for American industries, which pay taxes to the US government, which uses some of these taxes to finance further research in nuclear physics.

The Scientific Revolution has not been a revolution of knowledge. It has been above all a revolution of ignorance. The great discovery that launched the Scientific Revolution was the discovery that humans do not know the answers to their most important questions. Premodern traditions of knowledge such as Islam, Christianity, Buddhism and Confucianism asserted that everything that is important to know about the world was already known. The great gods, or the one almighty God, or the wise people of the past possessed all-encompassing wisdom, which they revealed to us in scriptures and oral traditions. Ordinary mortals gained knowledge by delving into these ancient texts and traditions and understanding them properly. It was inconceivable that the Bible, the Qur’an or the Vedas were missing out on a crucial secret of the universe – a secret that might yet be discovered by flesh-and-blood creatures.

Ancient traditions of knowledge admitted only two kinds of ignorance. First, an individual might be ignorant of something important. To obtain the necessary knowledge, all he needed to do was ask somebody wiser. There was no need to discover something that nobody yet knew. For example, if a peasant in some thirteenth-century Yorkshire village wanted to know how the human race originated, he assumed that Christian tradition held the definitive answer. All he had to do was ask the local priest. Second, an entire tradition might be ignorant of unimportant things. By definition, whatever the great gods or the wise people of the past did not bother to tell us was unimportant. For example, if our Yorkshire peasant wanted to know how spiders weave their webs, it was pointless to ask the priest, because there was no answer to this question in any of the Christian Scriptures. That did not mean, however, that Christianity was deficient. Rather, it meant that understanding how spiders weave their webs was unimportant. After all, God knew perfectly well how spiders do it. If this were a vital piece of information, necessary for human prosperity and salvation, God would have included a comprehensive explanation in the Bible.

Most scientific studies are funded because somebody believes they can help attain some political, economic or religious goal. For example, in the sixteenth century, kings and bankers channelled enormous resources to finance geographical expeditions around the world but not a penny for studying child psychology. This is because kings and bankers surmised that the discovery of new geographical knowledge would enable them to conquer new lands and set up trade empires, whereas they couldn’t see any profit in understanding child psychology. In the 1940s the governments of America and the Soviet Union channelled enormous resources to the study of nuclear physics rather than underwater archaeology. They surmised that studying nuclear physics would enable them to develop nuclear weapons, whereas underwater archaeology was unlikely to help win wars. Scientists themselves are not always aware of the political, economic and religious interests that control the flow of money; many scientists do, in fact, act out of pure intellectual curiosity. However, only rarely do scientists dictate the scientific agenda.

In 1831, the Royal Navy sent the ship HMS Beagle to map the coasts of South America, the Falklands Islands and the Galapagos Islands. The navy needed this knowledge in order to be better prepared in the event of war. The ship’s captain, who was an amateur scientist, decided to add a geologist to the expedition to study geological formations they might encounter on the way. After several professional geologists refused his invitation, the captain offered the job to a twenty-two-year-old Cambridge graduate, Charles Darwin. Darwin had studied to become an Anglican parson but was far more interested in geology and natural sciences than in the Bible. He jumped at the opportunity, and the rest is history. The captain spent his time on the voyage drawing military maps while Darwin collected the empirical data and formulated the insights that would eventually become the theory of evolution.

On 20 July 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the surface of the moon. In the months leading up to their expedition, the Apollo 11 astronauts trained in a remote moon-like desert in the western United States. The area is home to several Native American communities, and there is a story – or legend – describing an encounter between the astronauts and one of the locals. One day as they were training, the astronauts came across an old Native American. The man asked them what they were doing there. They replied that they were part of a research expedition that would shortly travel to explore the moon. When the old man heard that, he fell silent for a few moments, and then asked the astronauts if they could do him a favour. ‘What do you want?’ they asked. ‘Well,’ said the old man, ‘the people of my tribe believe that holy spirits live on the moon. I was wondering if you could pass an important message to them from my people.’ ‘What’s the message?’ asked the astronauts. The man uttered something in his tribal language, and then asked the astronauts to repeat it again and again until they had memorised it correctly. ‘What does it mean?’ asked the astronauts. ‘Oh, I cannot tell you. It’s a secret that only our tribe and the moon spirits are allowed to know.’ When they returned to their base, the astronauts searched and searched until they found someone who could speak the tribal language, and asked him to translate the secret message. When they repeated what they had memorised, the translator started to laugh uproariously. When he calmed down, the astronauts asked him what it meant. The man explained that the sentence they had memorised so carefully said, ‘Don’t believe a single word these people are telling you. They have come to steal your lands.’

Indonesia is the world’s biggest archipelago. Its thousands upon thousands of islands were ruled in the early seventeenth century by hundreds of kingdoms, principalities, sultanates and tribes. When VOC merchants first arrived in Indonesia in 1603, their aims were strictly commercial. However, in order to secure their commercial interests and maximise the profits of the shareholders, VOC merchants began to fight against local potentates who charged inflated tariffs, as well as against European competitors. VOC armed its merchant ships with cannons; it recruited European, Japanese, Indian and Indonesian mercenaries; and it built forts and conducted full-scale battles and sieges. This enterprise may sound a little strange to us, but in the early modern age it was common for private companies to hire not only soldiers, but also generals and admirals, cannons and ships, and even entire off-the-shelf armies. The international community took this for granted and didn’t raise an eyebrow when a private company established an empire. Island after island fell to VOC mercenaries and a large part of Indonesia became a VOC colony. VOC ruled Indonesia for close to 200 years. Only in 1800 did the Dutch state assume control of Indonesia, making it a Dutch national colony for the following 150 years. Today some people warn that twenty-first-century corporations are accumulating too much power. Early modern history shows just how far that can go if businesses are allowed to pursue their self-interest unchecked.

The trains were much faster than the old carriages, so the quirky differences in local hours became a severe nuisance. In 1847, British train companies put their heads together and agreed that henceforth all train timetables would be calibrated to Greenwich Observatory time, rather than the local times of Liverpool, Manchester or Glasgow. More and more institutions followed the lead of the train companies. Finally, in 1880, the British government took the unprecedented step of legislating that all timetables in Britain must follow Greenwich. For the first time in history, a country adopted a national time and obliged its population to live according to an artificial clock rather than local ones or sunrise-to-sunset cycles.

However, if you’re a top executive earning $250,000 a year and you win $1 million in the lottery, or your company board suddenly decides to double your salary, your surge is likely to last only a few weeks.

Some air-conditioning systems are set at twenty-five degrees Celsius. Others are set at twenty degrees. Human happiness conditioning systems also differ from person to person. On a scale from one to ten, some people are born with a cheerful biochemical system that allows their mood to swing between levels six and ten, stabilising with time at eight. Such a person is quite happy even if she lives in an alienating big city, loses all her money in a stock-exchange crash and is diagnosed with diabetes. Other people are cursed with a gloomy biochemistry that swings between three and seven and stabilises at five. Such an unhappy person remains depressed even if she enjoys the support of a tight-knit community, wins millions in the lottery and is as healthy as an Olympic athlete. Indeed, even if our gloomy friend wins $50,000,000 in the morning, discovers the cure for both AIDS and cancer by noon, makes peace between Israelis and Palestinians that afternoon, and then in the evening reunites with her long-lost child who disappeared years ago – she would still be incapable of experiencing anything beyond level seven happiness. Her brain is simply not built for exhilaration, come what may. Think for a moment of your family and friends. You know some people who remain relatively joyful, no matter what befalls them. And then there are those who are always disgruntled, no matter what gifts the world lays at their feet. We tend to believe that if we could just change our workplace, get married, finish writing that novel, buy a new car or repay the mortgage, we would be on top of the world. Yet when we get what we desire we don’t seem to be any happier. Buying cars and writing novels do not change our biochemistry. They can startle it for a fleeting moment, but it is soon back to its set point.

How can this be squared with the above-mentioned psychological and sociological findings that, for example, married people are happier on average than singles? First, these findings are correlations – the direction of causation may be the opposite of what some researchers have assumed. It is true that married people are happier than singles and divorcees, but that does not necessarily mean that marriage produces happiness. It could be that happiness causes marriage. Or more correctly, that serotonin, dopamine and oxytocin bring about and maintain a marriage. People who are born with a cheerful biochemistry are generally happy and content. Such people are more attractive spouses, and consequently they have a greater chance of getting married. They are also less likely to divorce, because it is far easier to live with a happy and content spouse than with a depressed and dissatisfied one. Consequently, it’s true that married people are happier on average than singles, but a single woman prone to gloom because of her biochemistry would not necessarily become happier if she were to hook up with a husband. In addition, most biologists are not fanatics. They maintain that happiness is determined mainly by biochemistry, but they agree that psychological and sociological factors also have their place. Our mental air-conditioning system has some freedom of movement within predetermined borders. It is almost impossible to exceed the upper and lower emotional boundaries, but marriage and divorce can have an impact in the area between the two. Somebody born with an average of level five happiness would never dance wildly in the streets. But a good marriage should enable her to enjoy level seven from time to time, and to avoid the despondency of level three. If we accept the biological approach to happiness, then history turns out to be of minor importance, since most historical events have had no impact on our biochemistry. History can change the external stimuli that cause serotonin to be secreted, yet it does not change the resulting serotonin levels, and hence it cannot make people happier.

So our medieval ancestors were happy because they found meaning to life in collective delusions about the afterlife? Yes. As long as nobody punctured their fantasies, why shouldn’t they? As far as we can tell, from a purely scientific viewpoint, human life has absolutely no meaning. Humans are the outcome of blind evolutionary processes that operate without goal or purpose. Our actions are not part of some divine cosmic plan, and if planet Earth were to blow up tomorrow morning, the universe would probably keep going about its business as usual. As far as we can tell at this point, human subjectivity would not be missed. Hence any meaning that people ascribe to their lives is just a delusion. The other-worldly meanings medieval people found in their lives were no more deluded than the modern humanist, nationalist and capitalist meanings modern people find. The scientist who says her life is meaningful because she increases the store of human knowledge, the soldier who declares that his life is meaningful because he fights to defend his homeland, and the entrepreneur who finds meaning in building a new company are no less delusional than their medieval counterparts who found meaning in reading scriptures, going on a crusade or building a new cathedral. So perhaps happiness is synchronising one’s personal delusions of meaning with the prevailing collective delusions. As long as my personal narrative is in line with the narratives of the people around me, I can convince myself that my life is meaningful, and find happiness in that conviction. This is quite a depressing conclusion. Does happiness really depend on self-delusion?

The idea that feelings are not to be trusted is not restricted to Christianity. At least when it comes to the value of feelings, even Darwin and Dawkins might find common ground with St Paul and St Augustine. According to the selfish gene theory, natural selection makes people, like other organisms, choose what is good for the reproduction of their genes, even if it is bad for them as individuals. Most males spend their lives toiling, worrying, competing and fighting, instead of enjoying peaceful bliss, because their DNA manipulates them for its own selfish aims. Like Satan, DNA uses fleeting pleasures to tempt people and place them in its power.

Yet of all the projects currently under development, the most revolutionary is the attempt to devise a direct two-way brain-computer interface that will allow computers to read the electrical signals of a human brain, simultaneously transmitting signals that the brain can read in turn. What if such interfaces are used to directly link a brain to the Internet, or to directly link several brains to each other, thereby creating a sort of Inter-brain-net? What might happen to human memory, human consciousness and human identity if the brain has direct access to a collective memory bank? In such a situation, one cyborg could, for example, retrieve the memories of another – not hear about them, not read about them in an autobiography, not imagine them, but directly remember them as if they were his own. Or her own. What happens to concepts such as the self and gender identity when minds become collective? How could you know thyself or follow your dream if the dream is not in your mind but in some collective reservoir of aspirations? Such a cyborg would no longer be human, or even organic. It would be something completely different. It would be so fundamentally another kind of being that we cannot even grasp the philosophical, psychological or political implications.

Deep Blue had essentially “brute forced” its way to victory—relying largely on hardware customized to rapidly generate and evaluate positions from each move. It had also required real-life chess champions to add guiding heuristics to the software. Yes, the win was an impressive feat of engineering, but it was based on long-established technology that worked only on very constrained sets of issues. Remove Deep Blue from the geometric simplicity of an eight-by-eight-square chessboard and it wouldn’t seem very intelligent at all.

Deep learning’s big technical break finally arrived in the mid-2000s, when leading researcher Geoffrey Hinton discovered a way to efficiently train those new layers in neural networks. The result was like giving steroids to the old neural networks, multiplying their power to perform tasks such as speech and object recognition. Soon, these juiced-up neural networks—now rebranded as “deep learning”—could outperform older models at a variety of tasks. But years of ingrained prejudice against the neural networks approach led many AI researchers to overlook this “fringe” group that claimed outstanding results.

So how does deep learning do this? Fundamentally, these algorithms use massive amounts of data from a specific domain to make a decision that optimizes for a desired outcome. It does this by training itself to recognize deeply buried patterns and correlations connecting the many data points to the desired outcome. This pattern-finding process is easier when the data is labeled with that desired outcome—“cat” versus “no cat”; “clicked” versus “didn’t click”; “won game” versus “lost game.” It can then draw on its extensive knowledge of these correlations—many of which are invisible or irrelevant to human observers—to make better decisions than a human could.

It’s an environment of abundance that lends itself to lofty thinking, to envisioning elegant technical solutions to abstract problems. Throw in the valley’s rich history of computer science breakthroughs, and you’ve set the stage for the geeky-hippie hybrid ideology that has long defined Silicon Valley. Central to that ideology is a wide-eyed techno-optimism, a belief that every person and company can truly change the world through innovative thinking. Copying ideas or product features is frowned upon as a betrayal of the zeitgeist and an act that is beneath the moral code of a true entrepreneur. It’s all about “pure” innovation, creating a totally original product that generates what Steve Jobs called a “dent in the universe.” Startups that grow up in this kind of environment tend to be mission-driven. They start with a novel idea or idealistic goal, and they build a company around that. Company mission statements are clean and lofty, detached from earthly concerns or financial motivations.

Jarring as that mercenary attitude is to many Americans, the Chinese approach has deep historical and cultural roots. Rote memorization formed the core of Chinese education for millennia. Entry into the country’s imperial bureaucracy depended on word-for-word memorization of ancient texts and the ability to construct a perfect “eight-legged essay” following rigid stylistic guidelines. While Socrates encouraged his students to seek truth by questioning everything, ancient Chinese philosophers counseled people to follow the rituals of sages from the ancient past. Rigorous copying of perfection was seen as the route to true mastery.

Those divergent habits were starkest in the ways users interacted with a page of search results. Within focus groups, we were able to track a user’s eye movements and clicks across a given page of search results. We used that data to create heat maps of activity on the page: green highlights showed where the user had glanced, yellow highlights where they had stared intently, and red dots marked each of their clicks. Comparing heat maps generated by American and Chinese users makes for a striking contrast. The American users’ maps show a tight clustering of green and yellow in the upper left corner where the top search results appeared, with a couple of red dots for clicks on the top two results. American users remain on the page for around ten seconds before navigating away. In contrast, Chinese users’ heat maps look like a hot mess.

Eye-tracking maps revealed a deeper truth about the way both sets of users approached search.

That methodology was first explicitly formulated in Silicon Valley and popularized by the 2011 book The Lean Startup. Core to its philosophy is the idea that founders don’t know what product the market needs—the market knows what product the market needs. Instead of spending years and millions of dollars secretly creating their idea of the perfect product, startups should move quickly to release a “minimum viable product” that can tease out market demand for different functions. Internet-based startups can then receive instant feedback based on customer activity, letting them immediately begin iterating on the product: discard unused features, tack on new functions, and constantly test the waters of market demand. Lean startups must sense the subtle shifts in consumer behavior and then relentlessly tinker with products to meet that demand. They must be willing to abandon products or businesses when they don’t prove profitable, pivoting and redeploying to follow the money.

Each era of computing requires different kinds of chips. When desktops reigned supreme, chipmakers sought to maximize processing speed and graphics on a high-resolution screen, with far less concern about power consumption. (Desktops were, after all, always plugged in.) Intel mastered the design of these chips and made billions in the process. But with the advent of smartphones, demand shifted toward more efficient uses of power, and Qualcomm, whose chips were based on designs by the British firm ARM, took the throne as the undisputed chip king.

The horsepower of these AI engines depends on the digital data they have access to, and there’s currently no greater storehouse of this data than the major internet companies. But that data only becomes truly useful to algorithms once it has been labeled. In this case, “labeled” doesn’t mean you have to actively rate the content or tag it with a keyword. Labels simply come from linking a piece of data with a specific outcome: bought versus didn’t buy, clicked versus didn’t click, watched until the end versus switched videos. Those labels—our purchases, likes, views, or lingering moments on a web page—are then used to train algorithms to recommend more content that we’re likely to consume.

Business AI mines these databases for hidden correlations that often escape the naked eye and human brain. It draws on all the historic decisions and outcomes within an organization and uses labeled data to train an algorithm that can outperform even the most experienced human practitioners. That’s because humans normally make predictions on the basis of strong features, a handful of data points that are highly correlated to a specific outcome, often in a clear cause-and-effect relationship. For example, in predicting the likelihood of someone contracting diabetes, a person’s weight and body mass index are strong features. AI algorithms do indeed factor in these strong features, but they also look at thousands of other weak features: peripheral data points that might appear unrelated to the outcome but contain some predictive power when combined across tens of millions of examples. These subtle correlations are often impossible for any human to explain in terms of cause and effect: why do borrowers who take out loans on a Wednesday repay those loans faster? But algorithms that can combine thousands of those weak and strong features—often using complex mathematical relationships indecipherable to a human brain—will outperform even top-notch humans at many analytical business tasks.

AN OMO-POWERED EDUCATION These kinds of immersive OMO scenarios go far beyond shopping. These same techniques—visual identification, speech recognition, creation of a detailed profile based on one’s past behavior—can be used to create a highly tailored experience in education. Present-day education systems are still largely run on the nineteenth-century “factory model” of education: all students are forced to learn at the same speed, in the same way, at the same place, and at the same time. Schools take an “assembly line” approach, passing children from grade to grade each year, largely irrespective of whether or not they absorbed what was taught. It’s a model that once made sense given the severe limitations on teaching resources, namely, the time and attention of someone who can teach, monitor, and evaluate students. But AI can help us lift those limitations. The perception, recognition, and recommendation abilities of AI can tailor the learning process to each student and also free up teachers for more one-on-one instruction time. The AI-powered education experience takes place across four scenarios: in-class teaching, homework and drills, tests and grading, and customized tutoring. Performance and behavior in these four settings all feed into and build off of the bedrock of AI-powered education, the student profile. That profile contains a detailed accounting of everything that affects a student’s learning process, such as what concepts they already grasp well, what they struggle with, how they react to different teaching methods, how attentive they are during class, how quickly they answer questions, and what incentives drive them. To see how this data is gathered and used to upgrade the education process, let’s look at the four scenarios described above. During in-class teaching, schools will employ a dual-teacher model that combines a remote broadcast lecture from a top educator and more personal attention by the in-class teacher. For the first half of class, a top-rated teacher delivers a lecture via a large-screen television at the front of the class. That teacher lectures simultaneously to around twenty classrooms and asks questions that students must answer via handheld clickers, giving the lecturer real-time feedback on whether students comprehend the concepts. During the lecture, a video conference camera at the front of the room uses facial recognition and posture analysis to take attendance, check for student attentiveness, and assess the level of understanding based on gestures such as nodding, shaking one’s head, and expressions of puzzlement. All of this data—answers to clicker questions, attentiveness, comprehension—goes directly into the student profile, filling in a real-time picture of what the students know and what they need extra help with. But in-class learning is just a fraction of the whole AI-education picture. When students head home, the student profile combines with question-generating algorithms to create homework assignments precisely tailored to the students’ abilities. While the whiz kids must complete higher-level problems that challenge them, the students who have yet to fully grasp the material are given more fundamental questions and perhaps extra drills. At each step along the way, students’ time and performance on different problems feed into their student profiles, adjusting the subsequent problems to reinforce understanding. In addition, for classes such as English (which is mandatory in Chinese public schools), AI-powered speech recognition can bring top-flight English instruction to the most remote regions. High-performance speech recognition algorithms can be trained to assess students’ English pronunciation, helping them improve intonation and accent without the need for a native English speaker on site. From a teacher’s perspective, these same tools can be used to alleviate the burden of routine grading tasks, freeing up teachers to spend more time on the students themselves. Chinese companies have already used perception AI’s visual recognition abilities to build scanners that can grade multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank tests. Even in essays, standard errors such as spelling or grammar can be marked automatically, with predetermined deductions of points for certain mistakes. This AI-powered technology will save teachers’ time in correcting the basics, letting them shift that time to communicating with students about higher-level writing concepts. Finally, for students who are falling behind, the AI-powered student profile will notify parents of their child’s situation, giving a clear and detailed explanation of what concepts the student is struggling with. The parents can use this information to enlist a remote tutor through services such as VIPKid, which connects American teachers with Chinese students for online English classes. Remote tutoring has been around for some time, but perception AI now allows these platforms to continuously gather data on student engagement through expression and sentiment analysis. That data continually feeds into a student’s profile, helping the platforms filter for the kinds of teachers that keep students engaged. Almost all of the tools described here already exist, and many are being implemented in different classrooms across China. Taken together, they constitute a new AI-powered paradigm for education, one that merges the online and offline worlds to create a learning experience tailored to the needs and abilities of each student. China appears poised to leapfrog the United States in education AI, in large part due to voracious demand from Chinese parents. Chinese parents of only children pour money into their education, a result of deeply entrenched Chinese values, intense competition for university spots, and a public education system of mixed quality. Those parents have already driven services like VIPKid to a valuation of over $3 billion in just a few years’ time.

For the most part, members of the dystopian camp aren’t worried about the AI takeover as imagined in films like the Terminator series, with human-like robots “turning evil” and hunting down people in a power-hungry conquest of humanity. Superintelligence would be the product of human creation, not natural evolution, and thus wouldn’t have the same instincts for survival, reproduction, or domination that motivate humans or animals. Instead, it would likely just seek to achieve the goals given to it in the most efficient way possible. The fear is that if human beings presented an obstacle to achieving one of those goals—reverse global warming, for example—a superintelligent agent could easily, even accidentally, wipe us off the face of the earth. For a computer program whose intellectual imagination so dwarfed our own, this wouldn’t require anything as crude as gun-toting robots. Superintelligence’s profound understanding of chemistry, physics, and nanotechnology would allow for far more ingenious ways to instantly accomplish its goals. Researchers refer to this as the “control problem” or “value alignment problem,” and it’s something that worries even AGI optimists. Although timelines for these capabilities vary widely, Bostrom’s book presents surveys of AI researchers, giving a median prediction of 2040 for the creation of AGI, with superintelligence likely to follow within three decades of that.

So when BlackRock founder Larry Fink, head of the world’s largest asset management company, posted a letter to CEOs demanding greater attention to social impact, it sent shockwaves through corporations around the globe.

As a result, society increasingly is turning to the private sector and asking that companies respond to broader societal challenges. . . . Society is demanding that companies, both public and private, serve a social purpose. . . . Companies must benefit all of their stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers, and the communities in which they operate. Fink’s letter dropped just days before the 2018 World Economic Forum, an annual gathering of the global financial elite in Davos, Switzerland. I was attending the forum and watched as CEOs anxiously discussed the stern warning from a man whose firm controlled substantial ownership stakes in their companies. Many publicly professed sympathy for Fink’s message but privately declared his emphasis on broader social welfare to be anathema to the logic of private enterprise. Looked at narrowly enough, they’re right: publicly traded companies are in it to win it, bound by fiduciary duties to maximize profits. But in the age of AI, this cold logic of dollars and cents simply can’t hold. Blindly pursuing profits without any thought to social impact won’t just be morally dubious; it will be downright dangerous.

If great conversation will win the day, be sure to pick a friend for the singles event who can’t match your smooth delivery and rapier wit. By comparison, you’ll sound great.

We can also change our focus from narrow to broad. Let me explain with an example from a study conducted by two brilliant researchers, Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman. Suppose you have two errands to run today. The first is to buy a new pen, and the second is to buy a suit for work. At an office supply store, you find a nice pen for $25. You are set to buy it, when you remember that the same pen is on sale for $18 at another store 15 minutes away. What would you do? Do you decide to take the 15-minute trip to save the $7? Most people faced with this dilemma say that they would take the trip to save the $7. Now you are on your second task: you’re shopping for your suit. You find a luxurious gray pinstripe suit for $455 and decide to buy it, but then another customer whispers in your ear that the exact same suit is on sale for only $448 at another store, just 15 minutes away. Do you make this second 15-minute trip? In this case, most people say that they would not. But what is going on here? Is 15 minutes of your time worth $7, or isn’t it? In reality, of course, $7 is $7—no matter how you count it. The only question you should ask yourself in these cases is whether the trip across town, and the 15 extra minutes it would take, is worth the extra $7 you would save. Whether the amount from which this $7 will be saved is $10 or $10,000 should be irrelevant. This is the problem of relativity—we look at our decisions in a relative way and compare them locally to the available alternative. We compare the relative advantage of the cheap pen with the expensive one, and this contrast makes it obvious to us that we should spend the extra time to save the $7. At the same time, the relative advantage of the cheaper suit is very small, so we spend the extra $7.

This is also why it is so easy for a person to add $200 to a $5,000 catering bill for a soup entrée, when the same person will clip coupons to save 25 cents on a one-dollar can of condensed soup. Similarly, we find it easy to spend $3,000 to upgrade to leather seats when we buy a new $25,000 car, but difficult to spend the same amount on a new leather sofa (even though we know we will spend more time at home on the sofa than in the car). Yet if we just thought about this in a broader perspective, we could better assess what we could do with the $3,000 that we are considering spending on upgrading the car seats. Would we perhaps be better off spending it on books, clothes, or a vacation? Thinking broadly like this is not easy, because making relative judgments is the natural way we think. Can you get a handle on it? I know someone who can.

Toward the end of the tour I found myself in Barcelona. There I met Jon, an American tourist who, like me, did not speak any Spanish. We felt an immediate camaraderie. I imagine this kind of bonding happens often with travelers from the same country who are far from home and find themselves sharing observations about how they differ from the locals around them. Jon and I ended up having a wonderful dinner and a deeply personal discussion. He told me things that he seemed not to have shared before, and I did the same. There was an unusual closeness between us, as if we were long-lost brothers. After staying up very late talking, we both needed to sleep. We would not have a chance to meet again before parting ways the following morning, so we exchanged e-mail addresses. This was a mistake. About six months later, Jon and I met again for lunch in New York. This time, it was hard for me to figure out why I’d felt such a connection with him, and no doubt he felt the same. We had a perfectly amicable and interesting lunch, but it lacked the intensity of our first meeting, and I was left wondering why. In retrospect, I think it was because I’d fallen victim to the effects of relativity. When Jon and I first met, everyone around us was Spanish, and as cultural outsiders we were each other’s best alternative for companionship. But once we returned home to our beloved American families and friends, the basis for comparison switched back to “normal” mode. Given this situation, it was hard to understand why Jon or I would want to spend another evening in each other’s company rather than with those we love.

It turns out that the pain of paying has two interesting features. First, and most obviously, when we pay nothing (for example, when someone else foots the bill) we don’t feel any pain of paying. Second, and less obviously, the pain of paying is relatively insensitive to the amount that we pay. This means that we feel more pain of paying as the bill increases, but every additional dollar on the bill pains us less. (We call this “diminishing sensitivity.” Analogously, if you add one pound to an empty backpack, it feels like a substantial increase in weight. But adding a pound to a backpack that’s already laden with a laptop and some books does not feel like a big difference.) This diminishing sensitivity to the pain of paying means that the first dollar we pay will cause us the highest pain, the second dollar will cause us less, and so on, until we feel just a tiny twinge for, say, the forty-seventh dollar.

Certainly, there is no question that all these considerations make the “I’ll buy this time, you buy next time” approach less economically efficient. Nevertheless, given the huge benefits in terms of the pain of paying that this method delivers, I personally would be willing to sacrifice a few bucks here and there to reduce the pain of paying for my friends and myself.

Asking a friend to help move a large piece of furniture or a few boxes is fine. But asking a friend to help move a lot of boxes or furniture is not—especially if the friend is working side by side with movers who are getting paid for the same task. In this case, your friend might begin to feel that he’s being used. Similarly, asking your neighbor (who happens to be a lawyer) to bring in your mail while you’re on vacation is fine. But asking him to spend the same amount of time preparing a rental contract for you—free—is not.

Open-source software shows the potential of social norms. In the case of Linux and other collaborative projects, you can post a problem about a bug on one of the bulletin boards and see how fast someone, or often many people, will react to your request and fix the software—using their own leisure time. Could you pay for this level of service? Most likely. But if you had to hire people of the same caliber they would cost you an arm and a leg. Rather, people in these communities are happy to give their time to society at large (for which they get the same social benefits we all get from helping a friend paint a room). What can we learn from this that is applicable to the business world? There are social rewards that strongly motivate behavior—and one of the least used in corporate life is the encouragement of social rewards and reputation.

Organizations can also think consciously about how people react to social and market norms. Should you give an employee a gift worth $1,000 or pay him or her an extra $1,000 in cash? Which is better? If you ask the employees, the majority will most likely prefer cash over the gift. But the gift has its value, though this is sometimes ill understood—it can provide a boost to the social relationship between the employer and the employee, and by doing so provide long-term benefits to everyone. Think of it this way: who do you suppose is likely to work harder, show more loyalty, and truly love his work more—someone who is getting $1,000 in cash or someone who is getting a personal gift? Of course, a gift is a symbolic gesture. And to be sure, no one is going to work for gifts rather than a salary. For that matter, no one is going to work for nothing. But if you look at companies like Google, which offers a wide variety of benefits for employees (including free gourmet lunches), you can see how much goodwill is created by emphasizing the social side of the company-worker relationship. It’s remarkable how much work companies (particularly start-ups) can get out of people when social norms (such as the excitement of building something together) are stronger than market norms (such as salaries stepping up with each promotion). If corporations started thinking in terms of social norms, they would realize that these norms build loyalty and—more important—make people want to extend themselves to the degree that corporations need today: to be flexible, concerned, and willing to pitch in. That’s what a social relationship delivers.

Burning Man has many extraordinary aspects, but for me one of the most remarkable is its rejection of market norms. Money is not accepted at Burning Man.

Thus, people who can cook might fix a meal. Psychologists offer free counseling sessions. Masseuses massage those lying on tables before them. Those who have water offer showers. People give away drinks, homemade jewelry, and hugs. (I made some puzzles at the hobby shop at MIT, and gave them to people. Mostly, people enjoyed trying to solve them.) At first this was all very strange, but before long I found myself adopting the norms of Burning Man.

The answer, I believe, is not to re-create society as Burning Man, but to remember that social norms can play a far greater role in society than we have been giving them credit for.

Often, when I’m on a flight and the people sharing the row with me don’t immediately put their headphones on, I enter into an interesting discussion with one of them. Invariably, I learn a lot about my neighbor’s work, work history, and future projects. On the other hand, I discover very little about the person’s family, favorite music, movies, or hobbies. Unless my neighbor gives me a business card, I almost never learn his or her name until the moment we are both about to leave the plane. There are probably many reasons for this, but I suspect that one of them is that most people take a lot of pride in their work. Of course this may not be true of everyone, but I think that for many people the workplace is not just a source of money but also a source of motivation and self-definition.

However, in light of the experiments described in this chapter (as well as those in Chapter 4), we might want to consider the dark side of putting a price on pollution. If a company can be charged for spewing poisons into the environment, it might well decide, after a cost-benefit analysis, that it can go ahead and pollute a lot more. Once pollution is a market and companies pay for their right to pollute, morality and concern for the environment are nonissues. On the other hand, if pollution is something that cannot be purchased or traded, it would more naturally fall into the domain of social norms.

There’s another way that we can get drawn into ownership. Often, companies will have “trial” promotions. If we have a basic cable television package, for instance, we are lured into a “digital gold package” by a special “trial” rate (only $59 a month instead of the usual $89). After all, we tell ourselves, we can always go back to basic cable or downgrade to the “silver package.” But once we try the gold package, of course, we claim ownership of it. Will we really have the strength to downgrade back to basic or even to “digital silver”? Doubtful. At the onset, we may think that we can easily return to the basic service, but once we are comfortable with the digital picture, we begin to incorporate our ownership of it into our view of the world and ourselves, and quickly rationalize away the additional price. More than that, our aversion to loss—the loss of that nice crisp “gold package” picture and the extra channels—is too much for us to bear. In other words, before we make the switch we may not be certain that the cost of the digital gold package is worth the full price; but once we have it, the emotions of ownership come welling up, to tell us that the loss of “digital gold” is more painful than spending a few more dollars a month. We may think we can turn back, but that is actually much harder than we expected.

In 210 BC, a Chinese commander named Xiang Yu led his troops across the Yangtze River to attack the army of the Qin (Ch’in) dynasty. Pausing on the banks of the river for the night, his troops awakened in the morning to find, to their horror, that their ships were burning. They hurried to their feet to fight off their attackers, but soon discovered that it was Xiang Yu himself who had set their ships on fire, and that he had also ordered all the cooking pots crushed. Xiang Yu explained to his troops that without the pots and the ships, they had no other choice but to fight their way to victory or perish. That did not earn Xiang Yu a place on the Chinese army’s list of favorite commanders, but it did have a tremendous focusing effect on his troops: grabbing their lances and bows, they charged ferociously against the enemy and won nine consecutive battles, completely obliterating the main-force units of the Qin dynasty.

HOW CAN WE unshackle ourselves from this irrational impulse to chase worthless options? In 1941 the philosopher Erich Fromm wrote a book called Escape from Freedom. In a modern democracy, he said, people are beset not by a lack of opportunity, but by a dizzying abundance of it. In our modern society this is emphatically so. We are continually reminded that we can do anything and be anything we want to be. The problem is in living up to this dream. We must develop ourselves in every way possible; must taste every aspect of life; must make sure that of the 1,000 things to see before dying, we have not stopped at number 999. But then comes a problem—are we spreading ourselves too thin? The temptation Fromm was describing, I believe, is what we saw as we watched our participants racing from one door to another. Running from door to door is a strange enough human activity. But even stranger is our compulsion to chase after doors of little worth—opportunities that are nearly dead, or that hold little interest for us. My student Dana, for instance, had already concluded that one of her suitors was most likely a lost cause. Then why did she jeopardize her relationship with the other man by continuing to nourish the wilting relationship with the less appealing romantic partner? Similarly, how many times have we bought something on sale not because we really needed it but because by the end of the sale all of those items would be gone, and we could never have it at that price again?

What we need is to consciously start closing some of our doors. Small doors, of course, are rather easy to close. We can easily strike names off our holiday card lists or omit the tae kwon do from our daughter’s string of activities. But the bigger doors (or those that seem bigger) are harder to close. Doors that just might lead to a new career or to a better job might be hard to close. Doors that are tied to our dreams are also hard to close. So are relationships with certain people—even if they seem to be going nowhere. We have an irrational compulsion to keep doors open. It’s just the way we’re wired. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to close them. Think about a fictional episode: Rhett Butler leaving Scarlett O’Hara in Gone with the Wind, in the scene when Scarlett clings to him and begs him, “Where shall I go? What shall I do?” Rhett, after enduring too much from Scarlett, and finally having his fill of it, says, “Frankly, my dear, I don’t give a damn.” It’s not by chance that this line has been voted the most memorable in cinematographic history. It’s the emphatic closing of a door that gives it widespread appeal. And it should be a reminder to all of us that we have doors—little and big ones—which we ought to shut. We need to drop out of committees that are a waste of our time and stop sending holiday cards to people who have moved on to other lives and friends. We need to determine whether we really have time to watch basketball and play both golf and squash and keep our family together; perhaps we should put some of these sports behind us. We ought to shut them because they draw energy and commitment away from the doors that should be left open—and because they drive us crazy.

Here’s another example. One of my friends spent three months selecting a digital camera from two nearly identical models. When he finally made his selection, I asked him how many photo opportunities had he missed, how much of his valuable time he had spent making the selection, and how much he would have paid to have digital pictures of his family and friends documenting the last three months. More than the price of the camera, he said. Has something like this ever happened to you? What my friend (and also the donkey and Congress) failed to do when focusing on the similarities and minor differences between two things was to take into account the consequences of not deciding. The donkey failed to consider starving, Congress failed to consider the lives lost while it debated highway legislation, and my friend failed to consider all the great pictures he was missing, not to mention the time he was spending at Best Buy. More important, they all failed to take into consideration the relatively minor differences that would have come with either one of the decisions. My friend would have been equally happy with either camera; the donkey could have eaten either bale of hay; and the members of Congress could have gone home crowing over their accomplishments, regardless of the slight difference in bills. In other words, they all should have considered the decision an easy one. They could have even flipped a coin (figuratively, in the case of the donkey) and gotten on with their lives. But we don’t act that way, because we just can’t close those doors.

Moreover, if you’re really serious about your wine, you may want to go all out and purchase the glasses that are specific to burgundies, chardonnays, champagne, etc. Each type of glass is supposed to provide the appropriate environment, which should bring out the best in these wines (even though controlled studies find that the shape of the glass makes no difference at all in an objective blind taste test, that doesn’t stop people from perceiving a significant difference when they are handed the “correct glass”). Moreover, if you forget that the shape of the glass really has no effect on the taste of the wine, you yourself may be able to better enjoy the wine you consume in the appropriately shaped fancy glasses.

Of course, if we all cared about the common good or thought about the long-term consequences of our actions, we might not run into resource-sharing problems. But because human beings tend to focus on short-term benefits and our own immediate needs, such tragedies of the commons occur frequently. Take the wild salmon population, for example. While it is ideal for fishermen in general to limit their own catches so that the salmon population can be sustained, it’s more profitable for an individual fisherman to overfish in a given year. But if too many fishermen even slightly surpass the sustainable limit, the overall fish population becomes depleted. (For this reason, salmon fishermen are now constrained by law to a limited number every year). The current energy crisis is another example of the tragedy of the commons. Although there is a finite amount of fossil fuel in the world, some countries, industries, businesses, and individuals use far more than others while making little effort to minimize their impact on the common pool. Even public resources such as clean air, land, trees, and water fall victim to this problem. In the absence of cooperation among all the players in protecting such resources, a small number of misbehaving entities can have a devastating effect on everyone.

Finally came the students who were told to shred not only their worksheets but the bubble sheets as well—and then dip their hands into the money jar and withdraw whatever they deserved. Like angels they shredded their worksheets, stuck their hands into the money jar, and withdrew their coins. The problem was that these angels had dirty faces: their claims added up to an average 36.1 correct answers—quite a bit higher than the 32.6 of our control group, but basically the same as the other two groups who had the opportunity to cheat. What did we learn from this experiment? The first conclusion, is that when given the opportunity, many honest people will cheat. In fact, rather than finding that a few bad apples weighted the averages, we discovered that the majority of people cheated, and that they cheated just a little bit.* And before you blame the refined air at the Harvard Business School for this level of dishonesty, I should add that we conducted similar experiments at MIT, Princeton, UCLA, and Yale with similar results. The second, and more counterintuitive, result was even more impressive: once tempted to cheat, the participants didn’t seem to be as influenced by the risk of being caught as one might think. When the students were given the opportunity to cheat without being able to shred their papers, they increased their correct answers from 32.6 to 36.2. But when they were offered the chance to shred their papers—hiding their little crime completely—they didn’t push their dishonesty farther. They still cheated at about the same level. This means that even when we have no chance of getting caught, we still don’t become wildly dishonest.

We found that when people order out loud in sequence, they choose differently from when they order in private. When ordering sequentially (publicly), they order more types of beer per table—in essence opting for variety. A basic way to understand this is by thinking about the Summer Wheat Ale. This brew was not very attractive to most people. But when the other beers were “taken,” our participants felt that they had to choose something different—perhaps to show that they had a mind of their own and weren’t trying to copy the others—and so they chose a different beer, one that they may not have initially wanted, but one that conveyed their individuality.

This might be one of the reasons (though not the only one) why even voters in the heartlands of the liberal West are losing faith in the liberal story and in the democratic process. Ordinary people may not understand artificial intelligence and biotechnology, but they can sense that the future is passing them by. In 1938 the condition of the common person in the USSR, Germany or the USA may have been grim, but he was constantly told that he was the most important thing in the world, and that he was the future (provided, of course, that he was an ‘ordinary person’ rather than a Jew or an African). He looked at the propaganda posters – which typically depicted coal miners, steelworkers and housewives in heroic poses – and saw himself there: ‘I am in that poster! I am the hero of the future!’5 In 2018 the common person feels increasingly irrelevant. Lots of mysterious words are bandied around excitedly in TED talks, government think tanks and hi-tech conferences – globalisation, blockchain, genetic engineering, artificial intelligence, machine learning – and common people may well suspect that none of these words are about them. The liberal story was the story of ordinary people. How can it remain relevant to a world of cyborgs and networked algorithms?

At least in the short term, AI and robotics are unlikely to completely eliminate entire industries. Jobs that require specialisation in a narrow range of routinised activities will be automated. But it will be much more difficult to replace humans with machines in less routine jobs that demand the simultaneous use of a wide range of skills, and that involve dealing with unforeseen scenarios. Take healthcare, for example. Many doctors focus almost exclusively on processing information: they absorb medical data, analyse it, and produce a diagnosis. Nurses, in contrast, also need good motor and emotional skills in order to give a painful injection, replace a bandage, or restrain a violent patient. Hence we will probably have an AI family doctor on our smartphone decades before we have a reliable nurse robot.

These particular songs might not work well with other people, but are just perfect for your personality type. After helping you get in touch with the depths of your sadness, the algorithm would then play the one song in the world that is likely to cheer you up – perhaps because your subconscious connects it with a happy childhood memory that even you are not aware of.

On 7 December 2017 a critical milestone was reached, not when a computer defeated a human at chess – that’s old news – but when Google’s AlphaZero program defeated the Stockfish 8 program. Stockfish 8 was the world’s computer chess champion for 2016. It had access to centuries of accumulated human experience in chess, as well as to decades of computer experience. It was able to calculate 70 million chess positions per second. In contrast, AlphaZero performed only 80,000 such calculations per second, and its human creators never taught it any chess strategies – not even standard openings. Rather, AlphaZero used the latest machine-learning principles to self-learn chess by playing against itself. Nevertheless, out of a hundred games the novice AlphaZero played against Stockfish, AlphaZero won twenty-eight and tied seventy-two. It didn’t lose even once. Since AlphaZero learned nothing from any human, many of its winning moves and strategies seemed unconventional to human eyes. They may well be considered creative, if not downright genius. Can you guess how long it took AlphaZero to learn chess from scratch, prepare for the match against Stockfish, and develop its genius instincts? Four hours. That’s not a typo. For centuries, chess was considered one of the crowning glories of human intelligence. AlphaZero went from utter ignorance to creative mastery in four hours, without the help of any human guide.18

Though the communist plan to start a working-class revolution might well become outdated, maybe we should still aim to realise the communist goal by other means? It is debatable whether it is better to provide people with universal basic income (the capitalist paradise) or universal basic services (the communist paradise).

You might object that people were asked ‘What do you think?’ rather than ‘What do you feel?’, but this is a common misperception. Referendums and elections are always about human feelings, not about human rationality. If democracy were a matter of rational decision-making, there would be absolutely no reason to give all people equal voting rights – or perhaps any voting rights.

In the wake of the Brexit vote, eminent biologist Richard Dawkins protested that the vast majority of the British public – including himself – should never have been asked to vote in the referendum, because they lacked the necessary background in economics and political science. ‘You might as well call a nationwide plebiscite to decide whether Einstein got his algebra right, or let passengers vote on which runway the pilot should land.’3

The liberal belief in the feelings and free choices of individuals is neither natural nor very ancient. For thousands of years people believed that authority came from divine laws rather than from the human heart, and that we should therefore sanctify the word of God rather than human liberty. Only in the last few centuries did the source of authority shift from celestial deities to flesh-and-blood humans. Soon authority might shift again – from humans to algorithms.

At the same time computer scientists are giving us unprecedented data-processing power. When the biotech revolution merges with the infotech revolution, it will produce Big Data algorithms that can monitor and understand my feelings much better than I can, and then authority will probably shift from humans to computers.

This has also been happening with physical abilities, such as navigating space. People ask Google to guide them around. When they reach an intersection, their gut feeling might tell them ‘turn left’, but Google Maps says ‘turn right’. At first they listen to their gut feeling, turn left, get stuck in a traffic jam, and miss an important meeting. Next time they listen to Google, turn right, and make it on time. They learn from experience to trust Google. Within a year or two, they blindly rely on whatever Google Maps tells them, and if the smartphone fails, they are completely clueless. In March 2012 three Japanese tourists in Australia decided to take a day trip to a small offshore island, and drove their car straight into the Pacific Ocean. The driver, twenty-one-year-old Yuzu Nuda, later said that she just followed the instructions of the GPS and ‘it told us we could drive down there. It kept saying it would navigate us to a road. We got stuck.’12 In several similar incidents people drove into a lake, or fell off a demolished bridge, by apparently following GPS instructions.13 The ability to navigate is like a muscle – use it or lose it.14 The same is true for the ability to choose spouses or professions.

Every day I absorb countless data bits through emails, tweets and articles; process the data; and transmit back new bits through more emails, tweets and articles.

Maybe the algorithm found something in your DNA, your personal history or your Facebook account that it does not like. The algorithm discriminates against you not because you are a woman, or an African American – but because you are you. There is something specific about you that the algorithm does not like. You don’t know what it is, and even if you knew, you cannot organise with other people to protest, because there are no other people suffering the exact same prejudice. It is just you.

In truth, European civilisation is anything Europeans make of it, just as Christianity is anything Christians make of it, Islam is anything Muslims make of it, and Judaism is anything Jews make of it. And they have made of it remarkably different things over the centuries. Human groups are defined more by the changes they undergo than by any continuity, but they nevertheless manage to create for themselves ancient identities thanks to their storytelling skills. No matter what revolutions they experience, they can usually weave old and new into a single yarn. Even an individual may knit revolutionary personal changes into a coherent and powerful life story: ‘I am that person who was once a socialist, but then became a capitalist; I was born in France, and now live in the USA; I was married, and then got divorced; I had cancer, and then got well again.’ Similarly a human group such as the Germans may come to define itself by the very changes it underwent: ‘Once we were Nazis, but we have learnt our lesson, and now we are peaceful democrats.’ You don’t need to look for some unique German essence that manifested itself first in Wilhelm II, then in Hitler, and finally in Merkel. These radical transformations are precisely what define German identity. To be German in 2018 means to grapple with the difficult legacy of Nazism while upholding liberal and democratic values. Who knows what it will mean in 2050.

Meanwhile across the Channel, English, Scots, Welsh and Irish were gradually welded together (willingly or not) to form Britons.

In order to answer this question, we should first dispel a widespread myth. Contrary to common wisdom, nationalism is not a natural and eternal part of the human psyche, and it is not rooted in human biology. True, humans are social animals through and through, with group loyalty imprinted in their genes. However, for hundreds of thousands of years Homo sapiens and its hominid ancestors lived in small intimate communities numbering no more than a few dozen people. Humans easily develop loyalty to small intimate groups such as a tribe, an infantry company or a family business, but it is hardly natural for humans to be loyal to millions of utter strangers. Such mass loyalties have appeared only in the last few thousand years – yesterday morning, in evolutionary terms – and they require immense efforts of social construction.

It is a dangerous mistake to imagine that without nationalism we would all be living in a liberal paradise. More likely, we would be living in tribal chaos. Peaceful, prosperous and liberal countries such as Sweden, Germany and Switzerland all enjoy a strong sense of nationalism. The list of countries lacking robust national bonds includes Afghanistan, Somalia, Congo and most other failed states.1 The problem starts when benign patriotism morphs into chauvinistic ultra-nationalism. Instead of believing that my nation is unique – which is true of all nations – I might begin feeling that my nation is supreme, that I owe it my entire loyalty, and that I have no significant obligations to anyone else. This is fertile ground for violent conflicts. For generations the most basic criticism of nationalism was that it led to war.

Let’s start with humankind’s familiar nemesis: nuclear war. When the Daisy advertisement aired in 1964, two years after the Cuban Missile Crisis, nuclear annihilation was a palpable threat. Pundits and laypeople alike feared that humankind did not have the wisdom to avert destruction, and that it was only a matter of time before the Cold War turned scorching hot. In fact, humankind successfully rose to the nuclear challenge. Americans, Soviets, Europeans and Chinese changed the way geopolitics has been conducted for millennia, so that the Cold War ended with little bloodshed, and a new internationalist world order fostered an era of unprecedented peace. Not only was nuclear war averted, but war of all kinds declined. Since 1945 surprisingly few borders have been redrawn through naked aggression, and most countries have ceased using war as a standard political tool. In 2016, despite wars in Syria, Ukraine and several other hot spots, fewer people died from human violence than from obesity, from car accidents, or from suicide.3 This may well have been the greatest political and moral achievement of our times.

When it comes to formulating such ethical guidelines, nationalism suffers above all from a failure of the imagination. Nationalists think in terms of territorial conflicts lasting centuries, while the technological revolutions of the twenty-first century should really be understood in cosmic terms. After 4 billion years of organic life evolving by natural selection, science is ushering in the era of inorganic life shaped by intelligent design. In the process, Homo sapiens itself will likely disappear. Today we are still apes of the hominid family. We still share with Neanderthals and chimpanzees most of our bodily structures, physical abilities and mental faculties. Not only are our hands, eyes and brains distinctly hominid, but so are our lust, our love, anger and social bonds. Within a century or two, the combination of biotechnology and AI might result in bodily, physical and mental traits that completely break free of the hominid mould. Some believe that consciousness might even be severed from any organic structure, and could surf cyberspace free of all biological and physical constraints. On the other hand, we might witness the complete decoupling of intelligence from consciousness, and the development of AI might result in a world dominated by super-intelligent but completely non-conscious entities. What has Israeli, Russian or French nationalism got to say about this? In order to make wise choices about the future of life we need to go way beyond the nationalist viewpoint and look at things from a global or even a cosmic perspective.

When you face a difficult economic dilemma, you read Marx and Hayek closely, and they help you understand the economic system better, see things from a new angle, and think about potential solutions. Having formulated an answer, you then turn to the Quran, and you read it closely in search of some surah that, if interpreted imaginatively enough, can justify the solution you got from Hayek or Marx.

He gets upset when women wear short-sleeved shirts, when two men have sex with one another, or when teenagers masturbate. Some people say He does not like us to ever drink alcohol, whereas according to others He positively demands that we drink wine every Friday night or every Sunday morning. Entire libraries have been written to explain in the minutest details exactly what He wants and what He dislikes. The most fundamental characteristic of this worldly lawgiver is that we can say extremely concrete things about Him. This is the God of the crusaders and jihadists, of the inquisitors, the misogynists and the homophobes. This is the God we talk about when we stand around a burning pyre, hurling stones and abuses at the heretics being grilled there.

<blockquote>
The third of the biblical Ten Commandments instructs humans never to make wrongful use of the name of God. Many understand this in a childish way, as a prohibition on uttering the explicit name of God (as in the famous Monty Python sketch ‘If you say Jehovah …’). Perhaps the deeper meaning of this commandment is that we should never use the name of God to justify our political interests, our economic ambitions or our personal hatreds. People hate somebody and say, ‘God hates him’; people covet a piece of land and say, ‘God wants it’. The world would be a much better place if we followed the third commandment more devotedly. You want to wage war on your neighbours and steal their land? Leave God out of it, and find yourself some other excuse.

Of course the cosmic mystery doesn’t help us at all in maintaining the social order. People often argue that we must believe in a god that gave some very concrete laws to humans, or else morality will disappear and society will collapse into primeval chaos. It is certainly true that belief in gods was vital for various social orders, and that it sometimes had positive consequences. Indeed, the very same religions that inspire hate and bigotry in some people inspire love and compassion in others.

Morality doesn’t mean ‘following divine commands’. It means ‘reducing suffering’. Hence in order to act morally, you don’t need to believe in any myth or story. You just need to develop a deep appreciation of suffering. If you really understand how an action causes unnecessary suffering to yourself or to others, you will naturally abstain from it. People nevertheless murder, rape and steal because they have only a superficial appreciation of the misery this causes. They are fixated on satisfying their immediate lust or greed, without concern for the impact on others – or even for the long-term impact on themselves. Even inquisitors who deliberately inflict as much pain as possible on their victim, usually use various desensitising and dehumanising techniques in order to distance themselves from what they are doing.

What does it mean to be secular? Secularism is sometimes defined as the negation of religion, and secular people are therefore characterised by what they don’t believe and do. According to this definition, secular people do not believe in any gods or angels, do not go to churches and temples, and do not perform rites and rituals.

What then is the secular ideal? The most important secular commitment is to the truth, which is based on observation and evidence rather than on mere faith. Seculars strive not to confuse truth with belief. If you have a very strong belief in some story, that may tell us a lot of interesting things about your psychology, about your childhood, and about your brain structure – but it does not prove that the story is true. (Often, strong beliefs are needed precisely when the story isn’t true.)

In addition, seculars do not sanctify any group, any person or any book as if it and it alone has sole custody of the truth. Instead, secular people sanctify the truth wherever it may reveal itself – in ancient fossilised bones, in images of far-off galaxies, in tables of statistical data, or in the writings of various human traditions. This commitment to the truth underlies modern science, which has enabled humankind to split the atom, decipher the genome, track the evolution of life, and understand the history of humanity itself.

The other chief commitment of secular people is to compassion. Secular ethics relies not on obeying the edicts of this or that god, but rather on a deep appreciation of suffering. For example, secular people abstain from murder not because some ancient book forbids it, but because killing inflicts immense suffering on sentient beings. There is something deeply troubling and dangerous about people who avoid killing just because ‘God says so’. Such people are motivated by obedience rather than compassion, and what will they do if they come to believe that their god commands them to kill heretics, witches, adulterers or foreigners?

We cannot search for the truth and for the way out of suffering without the freedom to think, investigate, and experiment. Secular people cherish freedom, and refrain from investing supreme authority in any text, institution or leader as the ultimate judge of what’s true and what’s right. Humans should always retain the freedom to doubt, to check again, to hear a second opinion, to try a different path. Secular people admire Galileo Galilei who dared to question whether the earth really sits motionless at the centre of the universe; they admire the masses of common people who stormed the Bastille in 1789 and brought down the despotic regime of Louis XVI; and they admire Rosa Parks who had the courage to sit down on a bus seat reserved for white passengers only.

Finally, secular people cherish responsibility. They don’t believe in any higher power that takes care of the world, punishes the wicked, rewards the just, and protects us from famine, plague or war. We flesh-and-blood mortals must take full responsibility for whatever we do – or don’t do. If the world is full of misery, it is our duty to find solutions. Secular people take pride in the immense achievements of modern societies, such as curing epidemics, feeding the hungry, and bringing peace to large parts of the world. We need not credit any divine protector with these achievements – they resulted from humans developing their own knowledge and compassion. Yet for exactly the same reason, we need to take full responsibility for the crimes and failings of modernity, from genocides to ecological degradation. Instead of praying for miracles, we need to ask what we can do to help.

In contrast, there is no expectation that religious people should deny God or abandon traditional rites and rituals. The secular world judges people on the basis of their behaviour rather than of their favourite clothes and ceremonies. A person can follow the most bizarre sectarian dress code and practise the strangest of religious ceremonies, yet act out of a deep commitment to the core secular values. There are plenty of Jewish scientists, Christian environmentalists, Muslim feminists and Hindu human-rights activists. If they are loyal to scientific truth, to compassion, to equality and to freedom, they are full members of the secular world, and there is absolutely no reason to demand that they take off their yarmulkes, crosses, hijabs or tilakas.

A couple of years ago I was invited to dinner with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Friends warned me not to go, but I couldn’t resist the temptation. I thought I might finally hear some big secrets that are divulged only to important ears behind closed doors. What a disappointment it was! There were about thirty people there, and everyone tried to get the Great Man’s attention, impress him with their wit, curry favour, or get something out of him. If anyone there knew any big secrets, they did an extremely good job of keeping them to themselves. This was hardly Netanyahu’s fault, or indeed anybody’s fault. It was the fault of the gravitational pull of power. If you really want truth, you need to escape the black hole of power, and allow yourself to waste a lot of time wandering here and there on the periphery. Revolutionary knowledge rarely makes it to the centre, because the centre is built on existing knowledge. The guardians of the old order usually determine who gets to reach the centres of power, and they tend to filter out the carriers of disturbing unconventional ideas. Of course they filter out an incredible amount of rubbish too. Not being invited to the Davos World Economic Forum is hardly a guarantee of wisdom. That’s why you need to waste so much time on the periphery – they may contain some brilliant revolutionary insights, but they are mostly full of uninformed guesses, debunked models, superstitious dogmas and ridiculous conspiracy theories.

Even if at fifteen you spent most of your day working in the family’s rice field (rather than in a formal school), the most important thing you were doing was learning: how to cultivate rice, how to conduct negotiations with the greedy rice merchants from the big city, and how to resolve conflicts over land and water with the other villagers. In the second part of life you relied on your accumulated skills to navigate the world, earn a living, and contribute to society. Of course even at fifty you continued to learn new things about rice, about merchants, and about conflicts, but these were just small tweaks to well-honed abilities.

By the middle of the twenty-first century, accelerating change plus longer lifespans will make this traditional model obsolete. Life will come apart at the seams, and there will be less and less continuity between different periods of life. ‘Who am I?’ will be a more urgent and complicated question than ever before.

<blockquote>
By the time you are fifty, you don’t want change, and most people have given up on conquering the world. Been there, done that, got the T-shirt. You much prefer stability. You have invested so much in your skills, your career, your identity and your world view that you don’t want to start all over again. The harder you’ve worked on building something, the more difficult it is to let go of it and make room for something new. You might still cherish new experiences and minor adjustments, but most people in their fifties aren’t ready to overhaul the deep structures of their identity and personality. There are neurological reasons for this. Though the adult brain is more flexible and volatile than was once thought, it is still less malleable than the teenage brain. Reconnecting neurons and rewiring synapses is damned hard work.5 But in the twenty-first century, you can hardly afford stability. If you try to hold on to some stable identity, job or world view, you risk being left behind as the world flies by you with a whooooosh. Given that life expectancy is likely to increase, you might subsequently have to spend many decades as a clueless fossil. To stay relevant – not just economically, but above all socially – you will need the ability to constantly learn and to reinvent yourself, certainly at a young age like fifty.

The Industrial Revolution has bequeathed us the production-line theory of education. In the middle of town there is a large concrete building divided into many identical rooms, each room equipped with rows of desks and chairs. At the sound of a bell, you go to one of these rooms together with thirty other kids who were all born the same year as you. Every hour some grown-up walks in, and starts talking. They are all paid to do so by the government. One of them tells you about the shape of the earth, another tells you about the human past, and a third tells you about the human body. It is easy to laugh at this model, and almost everybody agrees that no matter its past achievements, it is now bankrupt. But so far we haven’t created a viable alternative. Certainly not a scaleable alternative that can be implemented in rural Mexico rather than just in upmarket California suburbs.

Indeed, billions of people throughout history have believed that for their lives to have meaning, they don’t even need to be absorbed into a nation or a great ideological movement. It is enough if they just ‘leave something behind’, thereby ensuring that their personal story continues beyond their death. The ‘something’ I leave behind is ideally my soul or my personal essence. If I am reborn in a new body after the death of my present body, then death is not the end. It is merely the space between two chapters, and the plot that began in one chapter will carry on into the next. Many people have at least a vague faith in such a theory, even if they do not base it on any specific theology. They don’t need an elaborate dogma – they just need the reassuring feeling that their story continues beyond the horizon of death.

People who doubt that some kind of soul or spirit really survives their death therefore strive to leave behind something a bit more tangible. That ‘something tangible’ could take one of two forms: cultural or biological. I might leave behind a poem, say, or some of my precious genes. My life has meaning because people will still read my poem a hundred years from now, or because my kids and grandchildren will still be around. And what is the meaning of their lives? Well, that’s their problem, not mine. The meaning of life is thus a bit like playing with a live hand grenade. Once you pass it on to somebody else, you are safe.

For those who don’t trust any great chains, any future legacies or any collective epics, perhaps the safest and most parsimonious story they can turn to is romance. It doesn’t seek to go beyond the here and now. As countless love poems testify, when you are in love, the entire universe is reduced to the earlobe, the eyelash or the nipple of your beloved. When gazing at Juliet leaning her cheek upon her hand, Romeo exclaims ‘O, that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek!’ By connecting with a single body here and now, you feel connected with the entire cosmos. In truth, your beloved is just another human, no different in essence from the multitudes you ignore every day on the train and in the supermarket. But to you, he or she seems infinite, and you are happy to lose yourself in that infinity. Mystic poets of all traditions have often conflated romantic love with cosmic union, writing about God as a lover. Romantic poets have repaid the compliment by writing about their lovers as gods. If you are really in love with someone, you never worry about the meaning of life.

While a good story must give me a role, and must extend beyond my horizons, it need not be true. A story can be pure fiction, and yet provide me with an identity and make me feel that my life has meaning. Indeed, to the best of our scientific understanding, none of the thousands of stories that different cultures, religions and tribes have invented throughout history is true. They are all just human inventions. If you ask for the true meaning of life and get a story in reply, know that this is the wrong answer. The exact details don’t really matter. Any story is wrong, simply for being a story. The universe just does not work like a story.

The stories that provide us with meaning and identity are all fictional, but humans need to believe in them. So how to make the story feel real? It’s obvious why humans want to believe the story, but how do they actually believe? Already thousands of years ago priests and shamans discovered the answer: rituals. A ritual is a magical act that makes the abstract concrete and the fictional real. The essence of ritual is the magical spell ‘Hocus pocus, X is Y!’5 How to make Christ real to his devotees? In the ceremony of Mass, the priest takes a piece of bread and a glass of wine, and proclaims that the bread is Christ’s flesh, the wine is Christ’s blood, and by eating and drinking them the faithful attain communion with Christ. What could be more real than actually tasting Christ in your mouth? Traditionally, the priest made these bold proclamations in Latin, the ancient language of religion, law, and the secrets of life. In front of the amazed eyes of the assembled peasants the priest held high a piece of bread and exclaimed ‘Hoc est corpus!’– ‘This is the body!’ – and the bread supposedly became the flesh of Christ. In the minds of the illiterate peasants, who did not speak Latin, ‘Hoc est corpus!’ got garbled into ‘Hocus pocus!’ and thus was born the powerful spell that can transform a frog into a prince, and a pumpkin into a carriage.6

However, most people don’t like to admit that they are fools. Consequently, the more they sacrifice for a particular belief, the stronger their faith becomes. This is the mysterious alchemy of sacrifice. In order to bring us under his power, the sacrificing priest need not give us anything – neither rain, nor money, nor victory in war. Rather, he needs to take away something. Once he convinces us to make some painful sacrifice, we are trapped.

Even in romance, any aspiring Romeo or Werther knows that without sacrifice, there is no true love. The sacrifice is not just a way to convince your lover that you are serious – it is also a way to convince yourself that you are really in love. Why do you think women ask their lovers to bring them diamond rings? Once the lover makes such a huge financial sacrifice, he must convince himself that it was for a worthy cause.

Alternatively, if martyrs are scarce and people are unwilling to sacrifice themselves, the sacrificing priest may get them to sacrifice somebody else instead. You might sacrifice a human to the vengeful god Ba’al, burn a heretic at the stake for the greater glory of Jesus Christ, execute adulterous women because Allah said so, or send class enemies to the Gulag. Once you do that, a slightly different alchemy of sacrifice begins to work its magic on you. When you inflict suffering on yourself in the name of some story, it gives you a choice: ‘Either the story is true, or I am a gullible fool.’ When you inflict suffering on others, you are also given a choice: ‘Either the story is true, or I am a cruel villain.’ And just as we don’t want to admit we are fools, we also don’t want to admit we are villains, so we prefer to believe that the story is true.

The ancient Egyptians, Canaanites and Greeks hedged their sacrifices. They had many gods, and if one failed, they hoped that another would still come through. So they sacrificed to the sun god in the morning, to the earth goddess at noon, and to a mixed lot of fairies and demons in the evening. That too hasn’t changed much. All the stories and gods in which people today believe – be they Yahweh, Mammon, the Nation, or the Revolution – are incomplete, full of holes, and riddled with contradictions. Therefore people rarely put their entire faith in a single story. Instead, they keep a portfolio of several stories and several identities, switching from one to the other as the need arises. Such cognitive dissonances are inherent in almost all societies and movements. Consider a typical Tea Party supporter who somehow squares an ardent faith in Jesus Christ with a firm objection to government welfare policies and a staunch support for the National Rifle Association. Wasn’t Jesus a bit more keen on helping the poor than on arming yourself to the teeth? It might seem incompatible, but the human brain has a lot of drawers and compartments, and some neurons just don’t talk to one another. Similarly, you can find plenty of Bernie Sanders supporters who have a vague belief in some future revolution, while also believing in the importance of investing your money wisely. They can easily switch from discussing the unjust distribution of wealth in the world to discussing the performance of their Wall Street investments. Hardly anyone has just one identity. Nobody is just a Muslim, or just an Italian, or just a capitalist. But every now and then a fanatical creed comes along and insists that people should believe in only one story and have only one identity.

In recent generations the most fanatical such creed was fascism. Fascism insisted that people should not believe any story except the nationalist story, and should have no identity except their national identity. Not all nationalists are fascists. Most nationalists have great faith in the story of their nation, and emphasise the unique merits of their nation and the unique obligations they have towards their nation – but they nevertheless acknowledge that there is more to the world than just their nation. I can be a loyal Italian with special obligations towards the Italian nation, and still have other identities. I can also be a socialist, a Catholic, a husband, a father, a scientist and a vegetarian, and each of these identities entails additional obligations. Sometimes several of my identities pull me in different directions, and some of my obligations come into conflict with one another. But well, who said life was easy?

The word ‘fascism’ comes from the Latin ‘fascis’, meaning ‘a bundle of rods’. That sounds like a rather unglamorous symbol for one of the most ferocious and deadly ideologies in world history. But it has a deep and sinister meaning. A single rod is very weak, and you can easily snap it in two. However, once you bundle many rods together into a fascis, it becomes almost impossible to break them. This implies that the individual is a thing of no consequence, but as long as the collective sticks together, it is very powerful.

What’s true of sexual desire is true of all desire, and indeed of all feelings and thoughts. Just consider the next thought that pops up in your mind. Where did it come from? Did you freely choose to think it, and only then did you think it? Certainly not. The process of self-exploration begins with simple things, and becomes progressively harder. At first, we realise that we do not control the world outside us. I don’t decide when it rains. Then we realise that we do not control what’s happening inside our own body. I don’t control my blood pressure. Next, we understand that we don’t even govern our brain. I don’t tell the neurons when to fire. Ultimately we should realise that we do not control our desires, or even our reactions to these desires.

In the age of Facebook and Instagram you can observe this myth-making process more clearly than ever before, because some of it has been outsourced from the mind to the computer. It is fascinating and terrifying to behold people who spend countless hours constructing and embellishing a perfect self online, becoming attached to their own creation, and mistaking it for the truth about themselves.20 That’s how a family holiday fraught with traffic jams, petty squabbles and tense silences becomes a collection of beautiful panoramas, perfect dinners and smiling faces; 99 per cent of what we experience never becomes part of the story of the self. It is particularly noteworthy that our fantasy self tends to be very visual, whereas our actual experiences are corporeal. In the fantasy, you observe a scene in your mind’s eye or on the computer screen. You see yourself standing on a tropical beach, the blue sea behind you, a big smile on your face, one hand holding a cocktail, the other arm around your lover’s waist. Paradise. What the picture does not show is the annoying fly that bites your leg, the cramped feeling in your stomach from eating that rotten fish soup, the tension in your jaw as you fake a big smile, and the ugly fight the happy couple had five minutes ago. If we could only feel what the people in the photos felt while taking them!

Suffering emerges because people fail to appreciate this. They believe that there is some eternal essence somewhere, and if they can only find it and connect to it, they will be completely satisfied. This eternal essence is sometimes called God, sometimes the nation, sometimes the soul, sometimes the authentic self, and sometimes true love – and the more people are attached to it, the more disappointed and miserable they become due to the failure to find it. Worse yet, the greater the attachment, the greater the hatred such people develop towards any person, group or institution that seems to stand between them and their cherished goal.

<blockquote>
According to the Buddha, then, life has no meaning, and people don’t need to create any meaning. They just need to realise that there is no meaning, and thus be liberated from the suffering caused by our attachments and our identification with empty phenomena. ‘What should I do?’ ask people, and the Buddha advises: ‘Do nothing. Absolutely nothing.’ The whole problem is that we constantly do something. Not necessarily on the physical level – we can sit immobile for hours with closed eyes – yet on the mental level we are extremely busy creating stories and identities, fighting battles and winning victories. To really do nothing means that the mind too does nothing and creates nothing.

<blockquote>
Whenever politicians start talking in mystical terms, beware. They might be trying to disguise and excuse real suffering by wrapping it up in big incomprehensible words. Be particularly careful about the following four words: sacrifice, eternity, purity, redemption. If you hear any of these, sound the alarm. And if you happen to live in a country whose leader routinely says things like ‘Their sacrifice will redeem the purity of our eternal nation’ – know that you are in deep trouble. To save your sanity, always try to translate such hogwash into real terms: a soldier crying in agony, a woman beaten and brutalised, a child shaking in fear. So if you want to know the truth about the universe, about the meaning of life, and about your own identity, the best place to start is by observing suffering and exploring what it is. The answer isn’t a story.

But after a year of patient nudging, in April 2000 he got me to go to a ten-day Vipassana retreat.1 Previously I knew very little about meditation, and presumed it must involve all kinds of complicated mystical theories. I was therefore amazed by how practical the teaching turned out to be. The teacher at the course, S. N. Goenka, instructed the students to sit with crossed legs and closed eyes, and to focus all their attention on the breath coming in and out of their nostrils. ‘Don’t do anything,’ he kept saying. ‘Don’t try to control the breath or to breathe in any particular way. Just observe the reality of the present moment, whatever it may be. When the breath comes in, you are just aware – now the breath is coming in. When the breath goes out, you are just aware – now the breath is going out. And when you lose your focus and your mind starts wandering in memories and fantasies, you are just aware – now my mind has wandered away from the breath.’ It was the most important thing anybody ever told me.

<blockquote>
As the course progressed, students were taught to observe not just their breath, but sensations throughout their body. Not special sensations of bliss and ecstasy, but rather the most mundane and ordinary sensations: heat, pressure, pain and so on. The technique of Vipassana is based on the insight that the flow of mind is closely interlinked with body sensations. Between me and the world there are always body sensations. I never react to events in the outside world; I always react to the sensations in my own body. When the sensation is unpleasant, I react with aversion. When the sensation is pleasant, I react with cravings for more. Even when we think we react to what another person has done, to President Trump’s latest tweet, or to a distant childhood memory, the truth is we always react to our immediate bodily sensations. If we are outraged that somebody insulted our nation or our god, what makes the insult unbearable is the burning sensations in the pit of our stomach and the band of pain that grips our heart. Our nation feels nothing, but our body really hurts. You want to know what anger is? Well, just observe the sensations that arise and pass in your body while you are angry. I was twenty-four years old when I went to this retreat, and had experienced anger probably 10,000 times previously, yet I had never bothered to observe how anger actually feels. Whenever I had been angry, I focused on the object of my anger – something somebody did or said – rather than on the sensory reality of the anger. I think I learned more about myself and about humans in general by observing my sensations for these ten days than I learned in my whole life up to that point. And to do so I didn’t have to accept any story, theory, or mythology. I just had to observe reality as it is. The most important thing I realised was that the deepest source of my suffering is in the patterns of my own mind. When I want something and it doesn’t happen, my mind reacts by generating suffering. Suffering is not an objective condition in the outside world. It is a mental reaction generated by my own mind. Learning this is the first step towards ceasing to generate more suffering. Since that first course in 2000, I began meditating for two hours every day, and each year I take a long meditation retreat of a month or two. It is not an escape from reality. It is getting in touch with reality. At least for two hours a day I actually observe reality as it is, while for the other twenty-two hours I get overwhelmed by emails and tweets and cute-puppy videos. Without the focus and clarity provided by this practice, I could not have written Sapiens or Homo Deus. At least for me, meditation never came into conflict with scientific research. Rather, it has been another valuable tool in the scientific toolkit, especially when trying to understand the human mind.

Many people, including many scientists, tend to confuse the mind with the brain, but they are really very different things. The brain is a material network of neurons, synapses and biochemicals. The mind is a flow of subjective experiences, such as pain, pleasure, anger and love. Biologists assume that the brain somehow produces the mind, and that biochemical reactions in billions of neurons somehow produce experiences such as pain and love. However, so far we have absolutely no explanation for how the mind emerges from the brain. How come when billions of neurons are firing electrical signals in a particular pattern, I feel pain, and when the neurons fire in a different pattern, I feel love? We haven’t got a clue.

It’s a reminder that you control the situation and can leave whenever you like. You don’t have to be your own prison guard, keeping yourself locked up in a place that isn’t working. But that doesn’t mean quitting is easy. I’ve quit jobs that were a bad match and abandoned failing projects, and in each case it was terribly difficult. We’re taught that quitting is a sign of weakness, although in many circumstances it’s just the opposite. Sometimes quitting is the bravest alternative, because it requires you to face the fact that things are not working. The great news is that quitting allows you to start over with a clean slate. And if you take the time to evaluate what happened, quitting can be an invaluable learning experience.

If you decide to quit, make sure that you do it well. That is easier said than done. I’ve seen people quit gracefully and others quit so clumsily that they leave a huge crater in their wake. As discussed earlier, you are likely to bump into the same people again and again in life, often in unexpected ways. This alone is reason enough to make sure that when you quit, you do so with careful thought about the consequences for those around you. Besides the impact that quitting gracefully might have on you later, it is just the right thing to do. You can never rationalize quitting in such a way that you hurt your colleagues, friends, or former business.

There was a man who appeared to have endless luck with women. He wasn’t particularly charming, funny, smart, or attractive, so it was quite a mystery. One day my friend asked him how he managed to have such a steady flow of women in his life. He confided that it was simple—he asked every attractive woman he met for a date, and some of them said yes. He was willing to take his share of rejections in return for a handful of successes. This brings the lesson to its basest level. If you get out there and try lots of things, you’re much more likely to find success than someone who waits around for the phone to ring.
