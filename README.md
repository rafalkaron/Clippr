# Klipps
*Connect your Kindle to the computer, run Klipps, and automatically export your Kindle clippings to an HTML file on your desktop.*

## Klipps Quick Start Guide
*You export your Kindle clippings by connecting your Kindle to a computer and running Klipps.*

### Before you begin
  * Ensure that you highlighted some quotes while reading on your Kindle.
  * Ensure that your Kindle is connected to and discovered by your computer.
    **NOTE:** Some third-party USB cables may prevent your computer from correctly discovering your Kindle.

### Procedure
1. Download the latest Klipps version for your operating system. See [Klipps Releases](https://github.com/rafalkaron/Klipps/releases).
2. If needed, unzip **Klipps**.
3. Double-click the downloaded **Klipps** application.
4. If needed, accept every security prompt.

#### Results
1. Klipps opens in a **Terminal** window and tries to automatically detect the clippings file on the connected Kindle device.
2. If Klipps fails to automatically detect the clippings file, a prompt to manually enter the clippings file path appears.
3. Klipps exports the Kindle clippings file as a HTML file on your desktop.
**Note:** You can edit the default **Klipps** behavior by using dedicated arguments. For more information, run **Klipps** with the `--help` argument.
